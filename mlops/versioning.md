# 🗂️ What is Versioning in MLOps (Simple Explanation)

👉 Versioning = **keeping track of changes** so you can always:

* **Know what you used** (data, code, model).
* **Reproduce results** later.
* **Roll back** if something breaks.

Think of it like **saving game checkpoints 🎮** — so you can return to a known good state.

# 🔑 What to Version (4 things)

## 1. **Code 📝**

* Use Git (like saving snapshots of your code).
* Example:

  * v1 = logistic regression model
  * v2 = random forest model

👉 If your model suddenly performs worse, you can go back to the last version.

---

## 2. **Data 📊**

* Your model learns from data → if data changes, results change.
* So keep versions of the dataset you trained on.
* Example:

  * Dataset v1 = customers up to Jan
  * Dataset v2 = customers up to Feb

👉 That way you know *which dataset produced which model*.

---

## 3. **Models 🤖**

* Every time you train a model, save it as a new version.
* Example:

  * Model v1 → accuracy 80%
  * Model v2 → accuracy 85%
* Store info like: which code + which data = this model.

👉 Makes it easy to promote “best” models to production or roll back to older ones.

---

## 4. **Environment ⚙️**

* Models depend on software versions (like Python 3.9 vs. 3.11, or TensorFlow 2.10 vs. 2.12).
* If you don’t keep track, “works on my machine” happens.
* Example:

  * Env v1 → scikit-learn 1.2
  * Env v2 → scikit-learn 1.3

👉 Lock these versions so training and production match.

# 🎯 Why Versioning is Important

* **Reproducibility** → run the same experiment again and get the same results.
* **Debugging** → find out what changed when results got worse.
* **Collaboration** → teammates can use the exact same setup.
* **Safety** → roll back to a stable version when production fails.

# ✨ Everyday Analogy

Imagine you’re cooking 🍳:

* **Recipe (code)** = instructions.
* **Ingredients (data)** = what you cook with.
* **Cooked dish (model)** = the final output.
* **Kitchen setup (environment)** = tools & appliances.

If you don’t version:

* You may forget which recipe/ingredients gave the delicious dish.
* Next time it might taste different.

Versioning = **writing everything down clearly** so anyone can recreate the same dish.

# ✅ TL;DR

In MLOps, versioning = keeping track of **code + data + models + environment**.
It ensures you can always:

* Reproduce results
* Debug problems
* Roll back safely
