# 🛠️ What are Pipelines & Orchestration?

👉 **Pipeline** = a sequence of steps in your ML workflow (data → train → evaluate → deploy).
👉 **Orchestration** = the system that **manages, schedules, and monitors** those steps.

Think of it like a **production line in a factory 🏭**:

* Each step (cutting, assembling, painting) = pipeline step.
* The factory manager that ensures each step runs in the right order, retries on failure, and tracks output = orchestrator.

# 🔄 Why Do We Need Pipelines?

Without pipelines:

* You run notebooks manually (copy/paste).
* Hard to reproduce results.
* Easy to forget steps (e.g., forgot to validate data).
* No automation → can’t scale.

With pipelines:

* Steps are **repeatable** and **automated**.
* Anyone can rerun the same process.
* Easier to debug → logs show where it failed.
* Supports **CI/CD** for ML (continuous retraining & deployment).

# 🧩 Typical ML Pipeline Steps

1. **Data ingestion**

   * Load raw data from source (database, S3, API).

2. **Data validation & preprocessing**

   * Check schema, clean, transform.

3. **Feature engineering**

   * Create features (e.g., age from birthdate).

4. **Model training**

   * Train on training set.

5. **Model evaluation**

   * Compute accuracy, F1, AUC, etc.

6. **Model registration**

   * Save the model into a registry.

7. **Deployment**

   * Push to staging or production.

8. **Monitoring**

   * Track model performance and drift.

# 🧑‍💻 Orchestration Systems

These tools **schedule & manage pipelines**.

* **Airflow** → widely used, mature, good for batch pipelines.
* **Prefect** → modern, Pythonic, easy to use.
* **Dagster** → focus on data assets and lineage.
* **Kubeflow Pipelines** → cloud/Kubernetes native, deep ML focus.
* **MLFlow Pipelines (light)** → integrates with MLflow tracking.

They allow:

* **Scheduling** (run daily, weekly).
* **Retrying** failed steps automatically.
* **Parallelization** (e.g., train multiple models at once).
* **Monitoring** (see logs, failures, runtime).

# 👀 Example: Simple Pipeline in Prefect

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def load_data():
    return [1, 2, 3, 4]

@task
def preprocess(data):
    return [x * 2 for x in data]

@task
def train(data):
    print(f"Training on {data}")

@flow
def ml_pipeline():
    raw = load_data()
    clean = preprocess(raw)
    train(clean)

ml_pipeline()
```

➡️ Here, `load_data → preprocess → train` forms a **pipeline**, and Prefect manages the order, logs, and retries.

# ✨ Analogy

Imagine you’re baking 🍪:

* Steps: buy ingredients → mix → bake → decorate → serve.
* **Pipeline** = the recipe (ordered steps).
* **Orchestration** = the chef who makes sure every step is done at the right time, repeats if needed, and records results.

Without orchestration, you might forget to preheat the oven 🔥.

---

# ✅ TL;DR

* **Pipeline = ordered steps in ML workflow** (data → train → deploy).
* **Orchestration = system that automates & monitors the pipeline**.
* Benefits: repeatability, automation, debugging, scalability.
* Tools: Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, Kubeflow.
* Analogy: like a recipe (pipeline) and a chef managing the kitchen (orchestration).
