# Question 1:

Google: Two teams play a series of games (best of 7, whoever wins 4 games first) in which each team has a 50% chance of winning any given round (no draws allowed). What is the probability that the series goes to 7 games?

For the series to go to 7 games, each team must have won exactly three times for the first 6 games, an occurrence having probability

where the numerator is the number of ways of splitting up 3 games won by either side, and the denominator is the total number of possible outcomes of 6 games.
