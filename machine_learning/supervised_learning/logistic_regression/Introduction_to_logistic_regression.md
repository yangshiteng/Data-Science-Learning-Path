# Logistic regression

## Introduction

In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one.

- Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression). Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail which is represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled "0" and "1". In the logistic model, the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) for the value labeled "1" is a linear combination of one or more independent variables ("predictors")
- The independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value). The corresponding probability of the value labeled "1" can vary between 0 (certainly the value "0") and 1 (certainly the value "1"), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name. The unit of measurement for the log-odds scale is called a logit, from logistic unit, hence the alternative names. Analogous models with a different sigmoid function instead of the logistic function can also be used, such as the probit model; 


## What is Wrong with Linear Regression for Classification?

The linear regression model can work well for regression, but fails for classification. Why is that? In case of two classes, you could label one of the classes with 0 and the other with 1 and use linear regression. Technically it works and most linear model programs will spit out weights for you. But there are a few problems with this approach:

A linear model does not output probabilities, but it treats the classes as numbers (0 and 1) and fits the best hyperplane (for a single feature, it is a line) that minimizes the distances between the points and the hyperplane. So it simply interpolates between the points, and you cannot interpret it as probabilities.

## Types of Logistic Regression

1. Binary Logistic Regression
The categorical response has only two 2 possible outcomes. Example: Spam or Not

2. Multinomial Logistic Regression
Three or more categories without ordering. Example: Predicting which food is preferred more (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan)

3. Ordinal Logistic Regression
Three or more categories with ordering. Example: Movie rating from 1 to 5

## Decision Boundary

To predict which class a data belongs, a threshold can be set. Based upon this threshold, the obtained estimated probability is classified into classes.

Say, if predicted_value â‰¥ 0.5, then classify email as spam else as not spam.

Decision boundary can be linear or non-linear. Polynomial order can be increased to get complex decision boundary.

## Multinomial Logistic Regression

Multinomial logistic regression is an extension of logistic regression that adds native support for multi-class classification problems.

Logistic regression, by default, is limited to two-class classification problems. Some extensions like one-vs-rest can allow logistic regression to be used for multi-class classification problems, although they require that the classification problem first be transformed into multiple binary classification problems.

Instead, the multinomial logistic regression algorithm is an extension to the logistic regression model that involves changing the loss function to cross-entropy loss and predict probability distribution to a multinomial probability distribution to natively support multi-class classification problems.

By default, logistic regression cannot be used for classification tasks that have more than two class labels, so-called multi-class classification.

Instead, it requires modification to support multi-class classification problems.

One popular approach for adapting logistic regression to multi-class classification problems is to split the multi-class classification problem into multiple binary classification problems and fit a standard logistic regression model on each subproblem. Techniques of this type include one-vs-rest and one-vs-one wrapper models.

An alternate approach involves changing the logistic regression model to support the prediction of multiple class labels directly. Specifically, to predict the probability that an input example belongs to each known class label.

The probability distribution that defines multi-class probabilities is called a multinomial probability distribution. A logistic regression model that is adapted to learn and predict a multinomial probability distribution is referred to as Multinomial Logistic Regression. Similarly, we might refer to default or standard logistic regression as Binomial Logistic Regression.

- Binomial Logistic Regression: Standard logistic regression that predicts a binomial probability (i.e. for two classes) for each input example.
- Multinomial Logistic Regression: Modified version of logistic regression that predicts a multinomial probability (i.e. more than two classes) for each input example.

Changing logistic regression from binomial to multinomial probability requires a change to the loss function used to train the model (e.g. log loss to cross-entropy loss), and a change to the output from a single probability value to one probability for each class label.
