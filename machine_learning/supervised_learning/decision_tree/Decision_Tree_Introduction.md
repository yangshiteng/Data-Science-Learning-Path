# 1. Decision Tree

## 1.1 Introduction

Classification is a two-step process, learning step and prediction step, in machine learning. In the learning step, the model is developed based on given training data. In the prediction step, the model is used to predict the response for given data. Decision Tree is one of the easiest and popular classification algorithms to understand and interpret.

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.

Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms. Unlike other supervised learning algorithms, the decision tree algorithm can be used for solving both regression and classification problems.

The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).

In Decision Trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with the record’s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.

A decision tree is drawn upside down with its root at the top. In the image on the left, the bold text in black represents a condition/internal node, based on which the tree splits into branches/ edges. The end of the branch that doesn’t split anymore is the decision/leaf, in this case, whether the passenger died or survived, represented as red and green text respectively.

Although, a real dataset will have a lot more features and this will just be a branch in a much bigger tree, but you can’t ignore the simplicity of this algorithm. The feature importance is clear and relations can be viewed easily. This methodology is more commonly known as learning decision tree from data, and above tree is called Classification tree as the target is to classify passenger as survived or died. Regression trees are represented in the same manner, just they predict continuous values like price of a house. 

In general, Decision Tree algorithms are referred to as CART or Classification and Regression Trees.

So, what is actually going on in the background? Growing a tree involves deciding on which features to choose and what conditions to use for splitting, along with knowing when to stop to avoid overfitting. As a tree generally grows arbitrarily, you will need to trim it down for it to look beautiful. Lets start with a common technique used for splitting.

## Types of Decision Trees

Types of decision trees are based on the type of target variable we have. It can be of two types:

-  Classification Tree: Decision Tree which has a categorical target variable
-  Regression Tree: Decision Tree has a continuous target variable

## 1.2 Important Terminology related to Decision Trees

- Root Node: It represents the entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.
- Splitting: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
- Decision Node: When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called the decision node.
- Leaf / Terminal Node: Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node.
- Pruning: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say the opposite process of splitting.
- Branch / Sub-Tree: A subsection of the entire tree is called branch or sub-tree.
- Parent and Child Node: A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called a parent node of sub-nodes whereas sub-nodes are the child of a parent node.

Decision trees classify the examples by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf/terminal node, with the leaf/terminal node providing the classification of the example.


## 1.3 When to stop splitting?

You might ask when to stop growing a tree? As a problem usually has a large set of features, it results in large number of split, which in turn gives a huge tree. Such trees are complex and can lead to overfitting. So, we need to know when to stop? One way of doing this is to set a minimum number of training inputs to use on each leaf. For example we can use a minimum of 10 passengers to reach a decision(died or survived), and ignore any leaf that takes less than 10 passengers. Another way is to set maximum depth of your model. Maximum depth refers to the the length of the longest path from a root to a leaf.


## 1.4 Advantage

- Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.
- Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.
- The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.
- Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. However scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables for now. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for more information.
- Able to handle multi-output problems.
- Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.
- Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.
- Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.

## 1.5 Disadvantage

- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.
- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.
- Predictions of decision trees are neither smooth nor continuous, but piecewise constant approximations. Therefore, they are not good at extrapolation.
- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.


## 1.6 How to avoid overfitting in Decision Trees?

The common problem with Decision trees, especially having a table full of columns, they fit a lot. Sometimes it looks like the tree memorized the training data set. If there is no limit set on a decision tree, it will give you 100% accuracy on the training data set because in the worse case it will end up making 1 leaf for each observation. Thus this affects the accuracy when predicting samples that are not part of the training set.

Here are four ways to remove overfitting:

- Set the minimum number of samples in each leaf
- Set the maximum depth of the tree
- Pruning Decision Trees.
- Random Forest

### Pruning

The performance of a tree can be further increased by pruning. It involves removing the branches that make use of features having low importance. This way, we reduce the complexity of tree, and thus increasing its predictive power by reducing overfitting.

Pruning can start at either root or the leaves. The simplest method of pruning starts at leaves and removes each node with most popular class in that leaf, this change is kept if it doesn't deteriorate accuracy. Its also called reduced error pruning. More sophisticated pruning methods can be used such as cost complexity pruning where a learning parameter (alpha) is used to weigh whether nodes can be removed based on the size of the sub-tree. This is also known as weakest link pruning.

In pruning, you trim off the branches of the tree, i.e., remove the decision nodes starting from the leaf node such that the overall accuracy is not disturbed. This is done by segregating the actual training set into two sets: training data set, D and validation data set, V. Prepare the decision tree using the segregated training data set, D. Then continue trimming the tree accordingly to optimize the accuracy of the validation data set, V.

### Random Forest

Random Forest is an example of ensemble learning, in which we combine multiple machine learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance.

Why the name “Random”?

Two key concepts that give it the name random:

- A random sampling of training data set when building trees.
- Random subsets of features considered when splitting nodes.

A technique known as bagging is used to create an ensemble of trees where multiple training sets are generated with replacement.

In the bagging technique, a data set is divided into N samples using randomized sampling. Then, using a single learning algorithm a model is built on all samples. Later, the resultant predictions are combined using voting or averaging in parallel.
