# Familywise Error Rate (FWER)

The familywise error rate (FWER) is the probability of making one or more false discoveries, or type I errors when performing multiple hypotheses tests.
In other words, it's the probability of making at least one Type I Error. And it can be controlled by Bonferroni correction.
