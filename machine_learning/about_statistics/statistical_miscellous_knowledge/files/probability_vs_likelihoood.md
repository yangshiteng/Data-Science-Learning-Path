# Likelihood Interpretation

* suppose x ~ N(0,1), and we take one sample from it, x = 0.1
* someone said, x may from N(5,1)
* Then, we can calculate the likelhood for both N(0,1) and N(5,1)
* Obviously, the likelihood of N(0,1) is larger than the one of N(5,1)
* So, x = 0.1 is not likely from N(5,1)
* Check Likelihood Ratio Test for more information
