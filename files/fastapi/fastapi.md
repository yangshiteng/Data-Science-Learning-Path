## 1. Install the fast api

    # install it with all the optional dependencies and features
    # that also includes uvicorn, that you can use as the server that runs your code
    
    pip install "fastapi[all]"

    # you can also install it part by part
    
    pip install fastapi
    pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

## 2. Create a simplest FastAPI file and run the server

    # Copy the following code to a file main.py
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    @app.get("/")
    def root():
        return {"message": "Hello World"}

    # file name must be main.py
    # also make sure you are in the same folder with your FastAPI app instance
    # with reload, you don't need to restart the API if you made any change in your py file
    # run the following code in your terminal
    
    uvicorn main:app --reload
