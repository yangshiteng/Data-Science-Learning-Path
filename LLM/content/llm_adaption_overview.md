# 🤖 What is LLM Adaptation?

LLM adaptation means: **teaching a big language model to work better for your needs** — without building it from scratch.

There are **3 main ways**:

---

## 1️⃣ Prompting ✍️

* **How**: You write smart instructions to guide the model.
* **Example**:
  “You are a friendly assistant. Answer in 3 short bullet points.”
* **Pros**: Easy, no training needed.
* **Cons**: Sometimes unreliable, hard to control perfectly.

👉 Best for: quick tests, simple tasks.

---

## 2️⃣ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 📚🔍

* **How**: You give the model extra knowledge from your own documents or database.
* **Example**:
  A company chatbot that looks up answers in the employee handbook before replying.
* **Pros**: Always up-to-date, accurate to your data.
* **Cons**: Needs setup (vector database, document search).

👉 Best for: Q&A systems, private or new knowledge.

---

## 3️⃣ Fine-tuning 🛠️

* **How**: You train the model a bit more with your own data.
* **Example**:
  Fine-tune so it always writes in your company’s style, or always outputs JSON.
* **Pros**: Strong control, very consistent.
* **Cons**: Needs good data + compute power, can be costly.

👉 Best for: style, strict formats, special tasks.

# 🎯 How They Work Together

* **Prompting** = “Tell it what to do.”
* **RAG** = “Give it the right info.”
* **Fine-tuning** = “Change how it thinks.”

👉 Real apps often **combine them**:

* Use **RAG** for facts 📚
* Use **Fine-tuning** for style 🖋️
* Use **Prompting** for final control 🎛️

# ✅ Quick Summary

LLM adaptation =

* **Prompting** → quick and cheap
* **RAG** → accurate with your data
* **Fine-tuning** → consistent style & skills
