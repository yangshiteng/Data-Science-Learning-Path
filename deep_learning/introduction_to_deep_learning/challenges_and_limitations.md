### ⚙️ **1. Data Dependence**
- **Deep learning needs massive amounts of labeled data** to perform well.
- In fields like medicine or law, data can be scarce, private, or expensive to label.
- Bad data = bad models. Garbage in, garbage out.

---

### 🧠 **2. Lack of Interpretability (Black Box Problem)**
- Deep models can be extremely **hard to understand or explain**.
- You might know it works, but **not why** it made a certain prediction.
- This is a big issue in high-stakes areas like:
  - Medicine
  - Criminal justice
  - Finance

---

### 💻 **3. Computational Cost**
- Training deep learning models requires **massive compute resources** (GPUs/TPUs).
- It can be **expensive**, energy-intensive, and **environmentally unfriendly**.
- Startups and individuals may struggle with the cost barrier.

---

### 📦 **4. Overfitting & Generalization**
- Deep models can **memorize training data** instead of learning general patterns.
- This makes them fail when faced with new or slightly different data (real-world distribution shifts).

---

### 🤖 **5. Bias & Fairness**
- Models often **inherit biases** from the data they’re trained on.
- For example:
  - Facial recognition systems may perform poorly on darker skin tones.
  - Hiring AIs may favor certain demographics if past hiring was biased.
- This leads to **ethical concerns and societal risks**.

---

### 🚫 **6. Lack of Common Sense**
- AI still struggles with **basic logic and real-world reasoning**.
- It might generate fluent language or spot patterns, but **without truly understanding**.
- For example: Chatbots can make stuff up ("hallucinate") or miss obvious contradictions.

---

### 🔐 **7. Security & Adversarial Attacks**
- Small, invisible changes to input data can **trick deep models** (especially in images).
- Example: Slight pixel changes can make an AI think a stop sign is a yield sign.
- Huge implications for safety in autonomous systems.

---

### 🧩 **8. Generalization to New Tasks (Transfer Learning Limitations)**
- While models like GPT can adapt, many DL models still **struggle to transfer knowledge** across domains without retraining.

### 📜 Summary Table:

| Challenge | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Data Hunger | Needs tons of labeled data |
| Black Box | Hard to interpret decisions |
| High Cost | Expensive to train and deploy |
| Bias & Ethics | Can reflect societal prejudices |
| Fragile to Inputs | Vulnerable to adversarial attacks |
| Poor Reasoning | Lacks human-like common sense |
| Transfer Issues | Doesn’t generalize well across tasks |
