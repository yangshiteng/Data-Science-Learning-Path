## 🧠 What is Transfer Learning?

**Transfer learning** is a broad machine learning technique where:

* You **reuse a model pretrained on one task** (usually on a large dataset)...
* ...and **adapt it for a different but related task**.

### 🔧 Example:

Use a model trained on **ImageNet** (millions of images) and apply it to **classify cats vs dogs** on your small custom dataset.

## 🛠️ What is Fine-Tuning?

**Fine-tuning** is a *specific strategy within transfer learning*. It means:

* You start from a **pretrained model**
* You **continue training some or all layers** on your **target dataset**
* The model weights get updated and adapted to your new task

### 🔧 Example:

You take BERT pretrained on English Wikipedia, then fine-tune it on a **sentiment classification** dataset like IMDb reviews.

| Aspect         | **Transfer Learning**                                      | **Fine-Tuning**                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope          | General technique                                          | Specific method                                       |
| Model training | May **freeze most layers** or use as a feature extractor   | Usually **unfreezes and retrains** parts of the model |
| Use case       | Adapting to a new domain or task                           | Improving task-specific performance                   |
| Example        | Use pretrained VGG16 to extract features from X-ray images | Retrain the last few layers of VGG16 on X-ray dataset |

## 🎯 Common Strategies

| Strategy               | What Happens                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Extraction** | Freeze all layers, use outputs as features (transfer learning only)          |
| **Fine-Tuning**        | Unfreeze last layers or whole model, and retrain (part of transfer learning) |
| **Full Fine-Tuning**   | Unfreeze all layers — expensive but powerful                                 |

## 🧩 Summary

* ✅ **All fine-tuning is transfer learning**.
* 🚫 **Not all transfer learning involves fine-tuning** (e.g., you can freeze the model and just extract features).
* Fine-tuning is typically used when you want to **improve model performance** on your specific task.
