### ðŸ¤– **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** â€“ *The Broadest Concept*

> **Definition**: AI is the science of making machines "smart" â€” able to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks.

**Includes:**
- Rule-based systems (if-this-then-that)
- Machine learning
- Robotics
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision

ðŸ§  **Think of AI as the umbrella** term that covers everything from a chess-playing bot to Siri or ChatGPT.

### ðŸ“ˆ **Machine Learning (ML)** â€“ *A Subset of AI*

> **Definition**: Machine learning is a way for machines to learn from data **without being explicitly programmed**.

**Key idea**: Instead of writing rules manually, you give a machine data, and it finds the patterns on its own.

Types of ML:
- Supervised Learning (with labels)
- Unsupervised Learning (no labels)
- Reinforcement Learning (learn through trial and error)

ðŸ’¡ **ML is how modern AI systems "learn" behaviors from data**.

### ðŸ§  **Deep Learning (DL)** â€“ *A Subset of Machine Learning*

> **Definition**: Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses **neural networks with many layers** (hence "deep") to model complex patterns.

**Why itâ€™s powerful**:
- Automatically extracts features (no manual engineering needed)
- Excellent at handling large datasets like images, audio, and text
- Powers modern tools like:
  - ChatGPT
  - Image recognition (e.g., face unlock)
  - Voice assistants
