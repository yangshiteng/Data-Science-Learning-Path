### 🔍 **Part 8.2: Decoder-Only Transformers – Introduction to GPT**

---

### ✅ **Quick Summary:**

**GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)** is a **decoder-only** Transformer model designed for **text generation**.
It predicts the **next word** in a sequence, making it ideal for tasks like writing, summarizing, translating, and answering questions.

## 🧠 **What is GPT?**

* Created by OpenAI (GPT-1 in 2018, GPT-2 in 2019, GPT-3 in 2020, GPT-4 in 2023)
* Based only on the **Transformer decoder stack**
* Trained using a simple but powerful goal:

  > **“Predict the next token, given previous tokens”** (a.k.a. causal language modeling)

## 🧱 **GPT Architecture (Decoder-Only)**

| Component | Description                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input     | Sequence of tokens (e.g., “The cat sat”)                 |
| Stack     | Transformer **decoder layers only** (e.g., 12–96 layers) |
| Output    | Predicts the **next token** one at a time                |

📌 GPT uses **masked self-attention** to ensure that **each word only sees the past**, never the future.

---

## 🔁 **Training Objective: Causal Language Modeling (CLM)**

* The model learns to **generate text** by predicting the **next word** at each step:

  > *Input: “The cat” → Predict: “sat”*
  > *Input: “The cat sat” → Predict: “on”*
* Loss is computed using **cross-entropy** between the predicted and true next token

📌 No masking needed at the data level — GPT handles this **with attention masks internally**.

---

## ✨ **Why GPT Is Good for Generation**

* Naturally suited for **left-to-right generation**
* Produces fluent, coherent long-form text
* Can handle a wide range of tasks **without task-specific fine-tuning**, via **in-context learning** or **few-shot prompting**

## 📊 **GPT Use Cases**

| Task                    | Example Input                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Text completion         | “Once upon a time...”                      |
| Chatbots / conversation | “Hello, how can I help you today?”         |
| Summarization           | “TL;DR:”                                   |
| Translation             | “Translate this to French: ‘Good morning’” |
| Code generation         | “Write a Python function to sort a list.”  |

## 🔄 **How GPT Is Used**

* **Prompt-based** interaction (e.g., few-shot or zero-shot)
* Can also be **fine-tuned** on domain-specific data (like ChatGPT fine-tuned on dialogue)

## 🧠 Comparison to BERT:

| Feature            | **BERT (Encoder-only)**  | **GPT (Decoder-only)**         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Direction          | Bidirectional            | Unidirectional (left-to-right) |
| Task focus         | Understanding            | Generation                     |
| Training objective | Masked Language Modeling | Causal Language Modeling       |
| Pretraining use    | Fine-tuned for tasks     | Prompted or fine-tuned         |
