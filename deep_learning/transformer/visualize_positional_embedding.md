### 🔍 **Visualizing Positional Embeddings**

---

### 🎯 **Goal:**

To build an intuitive understanding of how **positional embeddings** differ across positions and dimensions — especially for **sinusoidal vs. learnable** encodings.

---

## 🧮 **1. Sinusoidal Positional Encoding – Visual Pattern**

These encodings are **mathematical** and produce **wave-like patterns** that vary smoothly across positions and dimensions.

Let’s say you compute sinusoidal positional embeddings for 50 positions and 8 dimensions.

When you plot them, it looks like this:

```
Position (x-axis) vs. Embedding Value (y-axis)
Each line = 1 dimension
```

📈 **What you’ll see:**

* Sinusoidal **wave patterns**
* Low-frequency dimensions = slow curves
* High-frequency dimensions = fast wiggles
* No two positions have the same combination of values

This gives the model a **unique, smooth signature** for each position.

---

### 🔍 Example Visualization:

```
Dimension 1:   ~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dimension 2:  ~~~~~~~~
Dimension 3: ~~~~~~~~~~``~`
...
```

Each position produces a **blend of these waveforms**.

---

## 📊 Why It's Useful

* These patterns give **relative position** clues:
  E.g., the difference between position 10 and 11 is small → continuity.
* **Easy to extrapolate** to unseen lengths (e.g., beyond 512 tokens).

---

## 🧠 **2. Learnable Positional Encoding – Visual Pattern**

Here, you initialize **a matrix of embeddings**, one per position, and let the model **learn the values** during training.

If you visualize it:

* You’ll see a **random-looking heatmap** at first (before training)
* After training, the matrix **might contain structure**, but it's hard to interpret visually

> You’re more likely to see **clusters** or **separated bands**, but not smooth curves like in sinusoidal.

### 🔬 Side-by-Side Comparison:

| Feature          | Sinusoidal (Visual)        | Learnable (Visual)            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Pattern          | Wave-like, smooth          | Arbitrary, task-learned       |
| Interpretability | High                       | Low (but still effective)     |
| Pre-training     | None (computed on the fly) | Needs gradient updates        |
| Extrapolation    | Strong                     | Weak (limited to seen length) |

### 📌 Tools to Visualize It Yourself

You can try plotting positional embeddings in:

* **Matplotlib (Python)** using `plt.imshow(...)`
* Use `transformer.positional_encoding` tensors from models like:

  * **Hugging Face BERT/GPT**
  * **Custom PyTorch or TensorFlow implementations**
