# 🧾 Instruction Tuning

## 📘 What Is Instruction Tuning?

**Instruction tuning** is a method for adapting large pretrained language models by fine-tuning them on a large and diverse set of **task-specific datasets** — but critically, **framed as natural language instructions**.

> 🧠 The idea is to teach the model to **follow human instructions**, by exposing it to many examples of the format:
>
> ```
> Instruction: "Translate this sentence to French."
> Input: "Hello, how are you?"
> Output: "Bonjour, comment ça va ?"
> ```

Rather than just giving labeled pairs, you teach the model *what to do* using **textual descriptions of the task**.

## 🔍 Why Instruction Tuning?

### Before:

* LLMs required **manual prompt engineering**
* Needed **few-shot examples** to understand a task
* Struggled with **zero-shot generalization**

### After instruction tuning:

* Models can **follow a wide range of tasks** described in natural language
* **Zero-shot** and **few-shot** performance improves dramatically
* The model becomes more **helpful, aligned, and general-purpose**

---

## 🧠 Origins: Where Did It Start?

### 📜 Key Paper:

> **“Finetuned Language Models Are Zero-Shot Learners” — Sanh et al., 2021 (T0 model)**
> Also inspired by **FLAN (Google)** and **InstructGPT (OpenAI)**

### These models:

* Took base LLMs (T5, GPT, etc.)
* Fine-tuned them on thousands of tasks using **instruction templates**
* Made them capable of zero-shot task execution just from instructions

## 🧪 How Instruction Tuning Works — Step-by-Step

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Gather Diverse Task Data

Instruction tuning requires a **large mixture of datasets**, including:

* Question answering (e.g., SQuAD, TriviaQA)
* Summarization (CNN/DM, XSum)
* Sentiment classification (IMDB)
* Natural language inference (MNLI, ANLI)
* Paraphrasing
* Translation
* Common sense reasoning
* Conversational tasks

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Convert Examples into Instructions

Each datapoint is turned into a **prompt-style format**:

```
Instruction: Summarize the following news article.
Input: [article text]
Output: [summary]
```

Sometimes, datasets are reformatted into **multiple templates** for robustness.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Fine-tune the Model

You take a pretrained LLM like:

* T5 → FLAN-T5 (Google)
* GPT-3 → InstructGPT (OpenAI)
* BART → T0 (BigScience)

…and fine-tune it on the instruction-formatted dataset using supervised learning.

You optimize:

* Cross-entropy loss
* Teacher-forced generation (output vs. expected)

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Inference = Zero-Shot Instruction Following

After training, the model can now:

* Understand a variety of tasks **without examples**
* Generalize to **new instructions**
* Act more like an **intelligent assistant**

## 📚 Example of Instruction Format

| **Task**           | **Instruction Prompt Format**                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Summarization      | "Summarize this paragraph." + Input text                         |
| Sentiment Analysis | "Is this review positive or negative?" + Input text              |
| Paraphrasing       | "Rewrite the following sentence with different wording."         |
| QA                 | "Answer the question based on the passage." + Context + Question |
| NLI                | "Is the second sentence entailed by the first?" + 2 sentences    |

> The instruction is treated as a **first-class citizen** of the input.

## 💡 Why It Works

| Reason                     | Explanation                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Task abstraction         | The model learns the **mapping between instructions and output formats**, not just data |
| ✅ Multitask generalization | Seeing 1000s of tasks helps the model infer unseen ones                                 |
| ✅ Natural human alignment  | Human instruction → model action → useful assistant                                     |
| ✅ Prompt robustness        | Helps model handle various prompt phrasings                                             |
