# 🔧 **Model Tuning Methods for Transformers (Detailed Guide)**

Transformer models like **BERT**, **GPT**, **T5**, and **ViT** come pretrained on massive data. To adapt them for specific tasks, we use **model tuning methods**. These range from **heavy fine-tuning** to **lightweight techniques** like **prompt tuning**.

## 🚦 **Why Tuning Methods Differ**

| Goal                          | Solution Type                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Maximize accuracy             | Full fine-tuning                |
| Save memory or compute        | Prompt tuning or adapter tuning |
| Reuse base model across tasks | Adapter tuning, LoRA            |
| Quick task switching          | Prompt or adapter tuning        |

## 🧭 **Categories of Model Tuning Methods**

### ✅ 1. **Fine-Tuning** (Full or Partial)

### ✅ 2. **Prompt Tuning** (Soft Prompts)

### ✅ 3. **Adapter Tuning** (Plug-in layers)

---

Other advanced strategies (bonus):

* 🧪 **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
* 🧪 **Prefix Tuning**
* 🧪 **Instruction Tuning**

Let’s explore the **core three methods** in depth.

---

## 🧱 1. **Fine-Tuning**

*Train some or all of the model's original parameters*

---

### 🧠 **What It Is**

You take a pretrained model and continue training it on your labeled dataset, updating either:

* All layers (standard fine-tuning)
* Top few layers (partial fine-tuning)

### 🧩 **Where It’s Used**

* Classification (sentiment, spam, topic)
* NER (named entity recognition)
* Question answering
* Generation (summarization, translation)

### 🛠️ **How It Works**

* Attach a **task-specific head** (like a classifier or decoder)
* Feed input through the full model
* Compute task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy)
* **Backpropagate through the entire model**

### 📊 Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros                       | ❌ Cons                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Highest possible performance | Requires lots of compute & storage           |
| Adapts deeply to the task    | Risk of forgetting pretraining (overfitting) |
| Supports any task            | Not always reusable across tasks             |

---

## 🧱 2. **Prompt Tuning**

*Train a small set of task-specific "instructions"*

---

### 🧠 **What It Is**

You **freeze the full model**, and train only a **small, learnable prompt** (a sequence of virtual tokens prepended to inputs).

These are **not words** — they’re trainable embeddings.

### 🧩 **Where It’s Used**

* Few-shot classification
* Domain-specific generation
* When compute is limited

### 🛠️ **How It Works**

* Add trainable prompt vectors: `[v1, v2, ..., vN] + input`
* Only update these prompt vectors
* Model is never modified

### 📊 Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros                          | ❌ Cons                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Very lightweight (\~<1M params) | Less flexible than full tuning               |
| Fast to train, low memory usage | Needs a good base model                      |
| Easy to deploy and swap prompts | Doesn’t always match full tuning performance |

---

## 🧱 3. **Adapter Tuning**

*Add small trainable layers into a frozen Transformer*

---

### 🧠 **What It Is**

Instead of changing the original model, you **insert small adapter modules** (usually MLPs) between Transformer layers. Only these adapters are trained.

### 🧩 **Where It’s Used**

* Multi-task learning
* Efficient domain adaptation (e.g., legal vs. medical)
* Cloud deployment (reuse base model)

### 🛠️ **How It Works**

* Insert adapter modules:
  `x → LayerNorm → Adapter → Add & Norm`
* Freeze base model layers
* Train only the adapters

### 📊 Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros                         | ❌ Cons                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Good balance: small + accurate | Slightly more complexity           |
| Easy to store and switch       | May require adapter framework      |
| Modular (plug-in per task)     | Slightly slower than prompt tuning |
