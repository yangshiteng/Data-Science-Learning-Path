## 🧱 Core Components of Hugging Face Transformers

### 1. **Model Classes**

Examples:

* `BertModel`, `GPT2LMHeadModel`, `T5ForConditionalGeneration`
* Provide the architecture + pretrained weights

### 2. **Tokenizer Classes**

Examples:

* `BertTokenizer`, `GPT2Tokenizer`, `AutoTokenizer`
* Handle converting text to input tensors and back

### 3. **Auto Classes**

Simplify model/tokenizer loading:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
```

### 4. **Pipelines (High-Level Inference)**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
print(classifier("Transformers are amazing!"))
```

### 5. **Trainer API**

* Simplifies training/fine-tuning
* Handles batching, evaluation, logging, checkpointing

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
```
