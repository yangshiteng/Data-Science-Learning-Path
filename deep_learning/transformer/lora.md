# 🔄 **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for Transformers**

---

## 📘 What Is LoRA?

**LoRA** stands for **Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models**. It is a **parameter-efficient fine-tuning method** that lets you adapt large pretrained models **without updating the full weight matrices**.

> Instead of modifying the original weights (which are huge), LoRA **adds tiny low-rank matrices** to key layers, and only trains these.

---

## ⚙️ Why LoRA?

Fine-tuning all weights in large Transformers (e.g., GPT-3, T5) is:

* ❗ Memory-intensive
* ❗ Expensive to train
* ❗ Slow to deploy across tasks

LoRA solves this by:

* ✅ Keeping **base weights frozen**
* ✅ Injecting **small trainable updates** (low-rank matrices)
* ✅ Drastically **reducing trainable parameters**

It was introduced in:
**"LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models" – Hu et al., 2021**
[📄 arXiv:2106.09685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)

## 🧠 The Core Idea

### 🔧 Instead of fine-tuning a full weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$,

**LoRA learns:**

$$
W' = W + \Delta W
\quad \text{where} \quad \Delta W = A B
$$

* $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$: trainable **down-projection**
* $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$: trainable **up-projection**
* $r \ll d, k$: **rank** (small, e.g., 4, 8, 16)

🧠 These two matrices approximate a "directional tweak" to $W$, without updating it.

---

## 🧩 Where Is LoRA Applied?

In **attention and feed-forward layers**, especially:

* **Query (Q)** and **Value (V)** projections in self-attention
* Sometimes key (K) and output (O)
* Occasionally in the MLP layers

You can selectively apply LoRA to any **linear transformation** in the model.

## 🛠️ LoRA Architecture

### For a weight matrix $W$:

Original:

$$
y = W x
$$

With LoRA:

$$
y = W x + B (A x)
$$

Where:

* $A$: Down-project to rank $r$
* $B$: Up-project back to original size
* $W$: Frozen
* $A, B$: Trainable

## 🧪 Example: Training with LoRA

| Model    | Params (full fine-tune) | Params (LoRA) | Speed Gain   |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| GPT-2    | \~100M                  | \~500K        | \~10× faster |

## 💾 Modular LoRA Weights

You can train **task-specific LoRA modules**:

* Store only the tiny matrices $A$ and $B$
* Swap them in for different tasks (like adapters)

> 🧠 This is ideal for multi-task and federated deployments.

## 🧠 Summary Analogy

> LoRA is like **adding a sticky note** to a textbook:
> You **don’t change the book**, just annotate it in a **smart, compact** way.

---

## 🧠 One-Liner Summary:

> **LoRA** is a memory- and compute-efficient way to fine-tune large Transformers by injecting **trainable low-rank updates** into frozen layers — making it perfect for adapting LLMs without retraining the whole model.
