### 🔍 **Sinusoidal vs Learnable Positional Encodings**

---

### ✅ **Quick Summary:**

Transformers add **positional encodings** to token embeddings so the model can understand word order.
There are **two main ways** to create these positional encodings:

---

## 🧮 1. **Sinusoidal Positional Encoding** (Used in original Transformer)

### 📐 **What it is:**

A **fixed**, mathematical way of encoding position using sine and cosine waves of different frequencies.

### 🧠 **Why it works:**

* Each position gets a **unique pattern** of sine/cosine values.
* These patterns are **smooth and periodic**, so the model can:

  * Recognize position
  * Understand **relative distances** between words

### 📊 **Formula:**

For a position $pos$ and dimension $i$:

$$
\text{PE}_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)
$$

$$
\text{PE}_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)
$$

Where $d$ is the embedding dimension.

> For example, dimension 0 might use sin(pos),
> dimension 1 might use cos(pos / 10), and so on.

### ✅ **Pros:**

* No extra parameters to train
* Can extrapolate to **longer sequences** than seen in training
* Built-in understanding of **relative position**

### ❌ **Cons:**

* Less flexible — patterns are fixed
* Model must **learn how to use** these patterns

## 🧠 2. **Learnable Positional Encoding**

### 📐 **What it is:**

A **trainable lookup table**, just like word embeddings.

* For position 0, use vector $P_0$
* For position 1, use vector $P_1$, and so on

The model learns these vectors during training.

### ✅ **Pros:**

* Simple to implement
* May work better on **short, fixed-length sequences**
* Allows model to learn task-specific patterns

### ❌ **Cons:**

* Doesn’t generalize to **longer sequences** than the training set
* No inherent idea of distance or periodicity

| Feature                | Sinusoidal Encoding       | Learnable Encoding           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Type                   | Fixed (no training)       | Learned (trainable weights)  |
| Generalization         | Good for longer sequences | Limited to training range    |
| Relative position info | Implicitly available      | Must be learned from scratch |
| Usage in models        | Original Transformer, T5  | BERT, GPT, most modern LLMs  |

### 💬 Summary Analogy:

> Sinusoidal = A **mathematically generated rhythm** that the model can learn to interpret.
> Learnable = A **custom beat** the model composes for itself during training.
