### 🔍 **What Is a Fine-Tuned Model?**

---

### ✅ **Definition:**

A **fine-tuned model** is a **pretrained model** (like BERT, GPT, T5, etc.) that has been **further trained on a specific task or dataset** to make it perform better for that task.

It’s like taking a student who’s already been through general education and giving them **job-specific training**.

---

### 📚 **Analogy:**

> Pretraining is like going to university and learning general skills.
> Fine-tuning is like taking a short course to specialize in marketing, programming, or medicine.

### 🔁 **How Fine-Tuning Works (Simple Steps):**

1. **Start with a pretrained model** (e.g., BERT trained on Wikipedia).
2. **Add a task-specific head** (e.g., a classifier for sentiment).
3. **Train it on a labeled dataset** for that task.
4. The **base model weights are slightly adjusted** (fine-tuned) to fit the new data.

### 🔧 **Examples:**

| Base Model | Task                 | Fine-Tuned For                        |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| BERT       | Classification       | Sentiment, spam detection, NER        |
| GPT        | Text generation      | Legal writing, customer support, code |
| T5         | Text-to-text         | Translation, summarization, QA        |
| ViT        | Image classification | Medical images, satellite photos      |
| Whisper    | Speech-to-text       | Transcribe podcast/audio recordings   |

## 🔁 **Can All Transformer Models Be Fine-Tuned?**

### ✅ **Yes — but with different approaches depending on the architecture:**

| Model Type          | Fine-Tuning Style                    | Example Use                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Encoder-only**    | Add classification head              | BERT for sentiment/NER          |
| **Decoder-only**    | Continue next-token training         | GPT for chatbot, code gen       |
| **Encoder-decoder** | Task-specific supervised fine-tuning | T5/BART for summarization, QA   |
| **Vision models**   | Add image classifier head            | ViT for medical image detection |
| **Multimodal**      | Fine-tune all or partial layers      | CLIP for image-text alignment   |

### 🛠️ **Advanced Fine-Tuning Techniques (Optional)**

* **Freezing layers**: Only fine-tune the top layers to reduce compute.
* **LoRA / Adapter layers**: Add small trainable components to large models.
* **Prompt tuning**: Only train the prompt (no full fine-tuning).

### 🧠 One-Liner Summary:

> A **fine-tuned model** is a pretrained Transformer that has been **custom-trained on your specific task** — and yes, **all Transformer models can be fine-tuned** for better performance on targeted applications.
