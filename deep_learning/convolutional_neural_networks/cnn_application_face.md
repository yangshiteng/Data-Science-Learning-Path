# 🧠 **What are Face Recognition and Face Verification?**

| Task                 | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Face Recognition**  | Identify **who** a face belongs to among a known list of identities (classification). |
| **Face Verification** | Check **whether two faces** belong to the **same person** (binary decision: yes or no). |

✅ **Recognition** is a **multi-class classification** task.  
✅ **Verification** is a **matching/similarity** task.
