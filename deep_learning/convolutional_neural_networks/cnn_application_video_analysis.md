# 🧠 **What is Video Analysis and Activity Recognition?**

**Video Analysis** involves:
- Processing a **sequence of frames** over time (not just single images),
- Understanding both the **appearance** and **motion** information.

**Activity Recognition** is a specific video task where the goal is to:
- Identify **what activity is happening** in a video clip (e.g., running, dancing, cooking).

✅ CNNs are extended to handle **spatial + temporal information** for recognizing dynamic events from videos.
