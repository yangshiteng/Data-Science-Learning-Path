# 📚 **CNN Applications in Instance Segmentation**

# 🧠 **What is Instance Segmentation?**

In **instance segmentation**, the goal is to:
- **Detect each object** in an image (like object detection),
- **Classify each object**, and
- **Segment each object at pixel level** (like semantic segmentation),
- **Differentiate between individual objects**, even if they belong to the same class.

✅ **Instance segmentation = object detection + pixel-wise mask** per object.

It answers:  
> "Where exactly is each object, what is it, and which pixels belong to which instance?"
