# 🧠 **What is Super-Resolution Imaging?**

**Super-Resolution (SR)** is the task of:
- **Reconstructing a high-resolution (HR) image** from a **low-resolution (LR) input image**.

✅ **Goal**: Enhance image details — making images sharper, cleaner, and more detailed — without simply enlarging/blurring them like traditional interpolation (bicubic, nearest neighbor).
