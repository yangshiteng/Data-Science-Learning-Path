# 📚 **CNN Applications in Image Classification**

---

# 🧠 **What is Image Classification?**

In **image classification**, the task is to assign **one label** to an **entire input image**.

✅ The model looks at a full image (e.g., a cat, a dog, a plane) and outputs a **single class prediction** from a set of predefined classes.

CNNs revolutionized image classification by learning **hierarchical features**:  
- Edges and textures at early layers
- Object parts at middle layers
- Complete objects at deeper layers
