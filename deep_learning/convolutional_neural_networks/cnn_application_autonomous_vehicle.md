# 🧠 **What is the Role of CNNs in Autonomous Vehicles?**

In **autonomous driving**, a vehicle must:
- **Perceive** its environment accurately (what's around it),
- **Understand** the scene (interpret traffic, pedestrians, lanes),
- **Make decisions** safely in real-time.

✅ **CNNs are the backbone** of the **perception system**:  
They allow cars to **see and understand the world** through cameras and other sensors.
