# 🧠 **What is Semantic Segmentation?**

In **semantic segmentation**, the goal is to:
- **Classify every pixel** in the image into a category (e.g., sky, road, person, building).
- Produce an **output mask** where each pixel belongs to a specific class.

✅ Unlike classification or object detection, segmentation requires **pixel-level understanding** of images.
