# 📚 **CNN Applications in Object Detection**

# 🧠 **What is Object Detection?**

In **object detection**, the goal is to:
- **Locate** objects in an image (using bounding boxes)
- **Classify** each detected object

✅ Instead of predicting a single label (like in classification), object detection models predict **multiple bounding boxes + labels** in one image.
