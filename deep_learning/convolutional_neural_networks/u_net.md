## 🏗️ **Basic Idea of U-Net**

U-Net is specially designed for **semantic segmentation**, where the task is to **classify each pixel** of an image.

It has two main parts:
- **Encoder (Contracting Path)**:  
  - Downsamples the input
  - Captures **context** and **what** is in the image
- **Decoder (Expanding Path)**:  
  - Upsamples the feature maps
  - Restores **spatial information** and **where** things are

✅ Skip connections are added between corresponding layers of encoder and decoder to combine **low-level features** (fine details) with **high-level features** (context).

## 🧱 **Typical U-Net Architecture**

| **Part**         | **Details**                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input**         | Image (e.g., 572×572×1)                                  |
| **Encoder**       | 2× (Conv 3×3 → ReLU) → MaxPool 2×2 (stride 2)            |
| **Bottleneck**    | Deepest layer with 2× convolutions                       |
| **Decoder**       | Up-conv (transpose conv) → concat skip connection → 2× (Conv 3×3 → ReLU) |
| **Output**        | 1×1 convolution → segmentation map (same size as input)  |

## 📈 **Performance Highlights**

Originally developed for **biomedical image segmentation** (e.g., cell segmentation), U-Net quickly showed great results on:
- **Medical imaging** (MRI, CT scans)
- **Satellite imagery**
- **Self-driving cars** (road, lane detection)
- **Agriculture** (plant segmentation)

It works well even with **very small datasets**, thanks to heavy **data augmentation**.
