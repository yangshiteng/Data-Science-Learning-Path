## 🏗️ **What Makes U-Net Special?**

### ✅ 1. **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**
- **Encoder** (left path): contracts the image spatially while increasing feature depth  
- **Decoder** (right path): expands the features back to original image resolution

### ✅ 2. **Skip Connections**
- Connect encoder features directly to decoder layers
- Allows low-level details (e.g., edges) to guide high-level decisions
- Improves precision in boundary segmentation

### ✅ 3. **Fully Convolutional**
- Only uses convolutional layers → supports input images of various sizes

## 📐 **U-Net Architecture Breakdown**

### 🔷 **Contracting Path (Encoder)**

| Step         | Operation                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Conv block 1 | 3×3 Conv → ReLU → 3×3 Conv → ReLU → MaxPool |
| Conv block 2 | Same (double conv + pooling)               |
| …            | Downsampling continues (typically 4 levels)|

### 🔷 **Expanding Path (Decoder)**

| Step         | Operation                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Up-sample 1  | Up-conv (transpose conv) → concatenate skip feature |
| Conv block   | 3×3 Conv → ReLU → 3×3 Conv → ReLU                   |
| Repeat       | Until image is restored to original size            |

### 🔷 **Final Layer**
- 1×1 convolution → map to desired number of output channels (e.g., 1 for binary segmentation, or C for C-class segmentation)
