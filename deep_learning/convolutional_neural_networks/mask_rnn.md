## 📚 **What Problem Does Mask R-CNN Solve?**

Most object detection models (like Faster R-CNN, YOLO) do:
- **Where** is the object? → Bounding box
- **What** is the object? → Class label

**But Mask R-CNN does more:**
- **Where** the object is (bounding box)
- **What** the object is (classification)
- **Which pixels** belong to the object (mask prediction)

✅ It performs **pixel-accurate detection**, separating **each individual object** — even **different objects of the same class**.

## 🏗️ **How Mask R-CNN Works**

It has two main stages:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Stage 1** | Region Proposal Network (RPN) generates candidate object bounding boxes (Regions of Interest, RoIs). |
| **Stage 2** | For each RoI: classify object, refine bounding box, and predict pixel-level **segmentation mask**. |

## 🔥 **Key Innovations**

### ✅ 1. **RoI Align**
- Replaces RoI Pooling (used in Faster R-CNN).
- No quantization of coordinates — keeps features **perfectly aligned**.
- Greatly improves mask accuracy.

### ✅ 2. **Separate Mask Head**
- Adds an extra network branch that predicts a **binary mask** for each object.
- Runs **in parallel** with the box and class prediction.
