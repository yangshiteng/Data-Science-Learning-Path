# üìö **Applications of CNNs**

---

## üîπ **Image Classification**

**What:**  
- Assign a **single label** to the **entire image**.
- CNN extracts patterns like edges, textures, objects at different layers, and then predicts the most probable class.

**Examples:**  
- Recognizing cats vs dogs  
- ImageNet competition (classify among 1000 categories)

**Popular models:**  
- LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet

## üîπ **Object Detection**

**What:**  
- Locate **and** classify **multiple objects** in a single image.
- Output includes **bounding boxes** + **class labels**.

**How CNNs Help:**  
- CNN features feed into detection heads that predict boxes and classes.
- Region Proposal Networks (RPNs) or anchor-based approaches (e.g., YOLO).

**Examples:**  
- Detecting cars, pedestrians in self-driving cars  
- Face detection in photos

**Popular models:**  
- Faster R-CNN, YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet

## üîπ **Semantic Segmentation**

**What:**  
- Classify **each pixel** in an image into a category.
- All pixels belonging to a class (e.g., ‚Äúcat‚Äù) are labeled the same.

**How CNNs Help:**  
- Encoder extracts features ‚Üí Decoder upsamples features to original size ‚Üí Pixel-wise classification.

**Examples:**  
- Medical image segmentation (e.g., brain tumor regions)
- Scene understanding (road, sidewalk, cars for autonomous driving)

**Popular models:**  
- FCN (Fully Convolutional Network)  
- U-Net  
- DeepLab family (DeepLabV3+)

## üîπ **Instance Segmentation**

**What:**  
- Combines **object detection** and **semantic segmentation**.
- Detects objects and produces **separate segmentation masks** for each instance.

**How CNNs Help:**  
- A two-branch CNN predicts bounding boxes and mask maps.

**Examples:**

### üß† **Object Detection vs Semantic Segmentation vs Instance Segmentation**

| Feature                  | **Object Detection**                         | **Semantic Segmentation**                 | **Instance Segmentation**                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **What It Does**         | Detect **where** objects are and classify them | Label **each pixel** with a category      | Label **each pixel** and **differentiate between objects** |
| **Output**                | Bounding boxes + Class Labels               | Pixel-wise category map                  | Pixel-wise masks per object instance      |
| **Main Goal**             | Localization + Classification               | Dense pixel classification               | Dense pixel classification **per object** |
| **Example Question**      | "Where are the cars?"                       | "Which pixels belong to a car?"           | "Which pixels belong to **this car**, that car, etc.?" |
| **Visual Output**         | Rectangles around objects                   | Colored areas by class                   | Colored areas, but each object separate   |

## üîπ **Face Recognition / Face Verification**

### üß† **Face Recognition vs Face Verification**

| Feature               | **Face Recognition**                          | **Face Verification**                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**              | Identify **who** the person is                | Check **if two faces belong to the same person** |
| **Type of Task**      | **Multi-class classification**                | **Binary classification**                      |
| **Input**             | One face image                                | Two face images (or one + stored template)     |
| **Output**            | Predicted **identity** (e.g., "Alice")         | **Yes/No** (Are they the same person?)         |
| **Use Case**          | Face tagging in photos, employee check-in      | Phone unlocking, access control                |
| **Example**           | ‚ÄúWhich one of 1,000 identities is this?‚Äù       | ‚ÄúIs this face the same as the enrolled user?‚Äù  |

---

### üì∑ **Face Recognition**
> üß† ‚ÄúWho is this person?‚Äù

- The system compares the input face to a **database of known faces** and predicts the **closest match**.
- It‚Äôs like **classifying the face** into one of many known identities.

üîç **Examples:**
- Facebook/Google photo tagging
- Law enforcement systems identifying suspects from camera footage
- Time attendance system identifying each employee

---

### üîê **Face Verification**
> üß† ‚ÄúIs this the right person?‚Äù

- The system compares two faces and outputs a **similarity score** or **true/false** result.
- Often used in **1-to-1 matching** systems.

üîç **Examples:**
- Face ID on your iPhone (matches your face to stored profile)
- Online identity verification (match photo ID to selfie)
- Entry access systems (is this person allowed in?)

---

### ü§ñ **How CNNs Help in Both Tasks**

Both tasks typically use **the same CNN backbone** to extract **face embeddings** (feature vectors).

Then:
- **Recognition** compares the embedding to a list of known embeddings.
- **Verification** measures the distance between two embeddings (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance).

> Models like **FaceNet**, **ArcFace**, and **DeepFace** generate these embeddings.

### ‚úÖ Quick Analogy

| Scenario                    | Task                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| You're trying to **spot a friend** in a crowd | **Recognition** |
| You're shown a photo and asked, ‚ÄúIs this your friend?‚Äù | **Verification** |
