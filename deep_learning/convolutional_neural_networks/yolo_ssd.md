# 🧠 **YOLO / SSD: Real-Time Object Detection**

---

## 🔥 **1. YOLO (You Only Look Once)**

### 📌 Overview

| Feature                | Description                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Name**           | You Only Look Once (YOLO)                                |
| **Creator**             | Joseph Redmon et al.                                     |
| **First Published**     | 2016 (YOLOv1)                                             |
| **Key Idea**            | Treat detection as a **single regression problem** — no two-stage proposals |
| **Speed Focus**         | Extremely fast, real-time capable                        |

## 🏗️ **How YOLO Works**

Instead of proposing regions (like Faster R-CNN), **YOLO divides the image into an S×S grid**.  
Each grid cell:
- Predicts **bounding boxes**
- Predicts **class probabilities** for those boxes

Everything is predicted **in one pass** through the network.

✅ **One forward pass = detection and classification together.**

# 🔥 **2. SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)**

### 📌 Overview

| Feature                | Description                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Name**           | Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)                      |
| **Creators**            | Wei Liu et al. (University of Oxford + Facebook)         |
| **First Published**     | 2016                                                     |
| **Key Idea**            | Predict **bounding boxes** and **class scores** at **multiple feature map scales** |
| **Speed Focus**         | Balance between **accuracy** and **speed**               |

---

## 🏗️ **How SSD Works**

- Uses **multiple feature maps** at different scales.
- At each scale, small convolutional filters predict:
  - Bounding boxes
  - Class scores

✅ **Single-shot detection** — no need for two stages (like region proposals + classification).

✅ **Multi-scale prediction** — good for detecting **objects of different sizes** (small/medium/large).

---

### 🔹 SSD Key Features

- Base CNN (e.g., VGG16, MobileNet) extracts features.
- Additional feature layers added to capture multi-scale objects.
- Anchor boxes (default boxes) of different shapes and ratios are used.
