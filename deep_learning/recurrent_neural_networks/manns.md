## ðŸ“˜ **What Are Memory-Augmented RNNs?**

Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (MANNs) extend standard RNNs (like LSTMs) by **adding an external memory module** that can be **read from and written to**, much like the memory of a computer.

Two major architectures:

* ðŸ”¹ **Neural Turing Machine (NTM)** â€” introduced by DeepMind (2014)
* ðŸ”¹ **Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)** â€” an improved version of NTM (2016)

## ðŸ§  **Why Add External Memory?**

Standard RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs have **limited memory capacity**, and they often struggle with:

* Long-term dependencies
* Algorithmic tasks (e.g., copying, sorting, graph traversal)

**Memory-Augmented RNNs** provide:

* **Explicit memory storage** outside the hidden state
* **Random-access memory addressing** for complex reasoning
* **Learned read/write operations**

> They are designed to **learn algorithms** like sorting, copying, or pathfinding from data.

## ðŸ§± **Core Components (Shared by NTM and DNC)**

| Component                | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Controller**           | Typically an RNN (e.g., LSTM) that issues memory access commands        |
| **Memory Matrix**        | External matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times W}$ with N slots of width W |
| **Read Heads**           | Vectors that read from memory using differentiable attention            |
| **Write Heads**          | Vectors that write to memory (content-based and/or location-based)      |
| **Addressing Mechanism** | Determines how the model accesses memory â€” soft, differentiable         |

## ðŸ”¢ **Neural Turing Machine (NTM)**

### âœ… Key Features:

* Introduced by **Graves et al., 2014**
* **Soft, differentiable memory access**
* Uses **content-based addressing** (similarity search) and **location-based shifts** (move forward/backward)
* Reads and writes using **attention-weighted memory operations**

### ðŸ§® Example Operation:

* At each time step:

  * The controller (LSTM) receives an input
  * Computes **read weights** and extracts memory content
  * Computes **write weights** and updates the memory
  * Produces output from controller + memory read

### ðŸ§  Can Learn:

* Copying sequences
* Reversing sequences
* Sorting numbers
* Associative recall

## ðŸš€ **Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)**

### âœ… Improvements Over NTM:

* More robust and scalable memory usage
* Tracks **temporal linkages** between memory writes (helpful for sequences & graphs)
* Supports **multiple read/write heads**
* Introduces **memory usage tracking** to avoid overwriting useful memory

### ðŸ§® Advanced Capabilities:

* Graph traversal
* Question answering over knowledge bases
* Algorithm learning with intermediate steps

## ðŸ§ª **Training**

* Fully differentiable: trained end-to-end via backpropagation
* Complex behaviors emerge from **data and gradients**, not manual programming
* Sensitive to hyperparameters and often requires **curriculum learning**
