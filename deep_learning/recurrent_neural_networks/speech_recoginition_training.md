## 🏗 **Complete Training Process: Speech Recognition Using RNNs**

---

### 🌍 **Objective**

We want to train a model that can take an **audio recording** (like a spoken sentence) and output the corresponding **text transcription**.

For example:
🎤 Audio: “Hello, how are you?” → 📝 Text: “hello how are you”

This is the core of **automatic speech recognition (ASR)**.

---

### 🛠 **Step 1: Training Dataset**

---

We need a **labeled speech dataset** containing:

✅ Input: raw audio waveforms or audio files (usually `.wav` format).

✅ Target: corresponding text transcripts.

---

#### **Real-world dataset examples**

* **LibriSpeech** → Audiobook recordings + text.
* **Common Voice (Mozilla)** → Crowdsourced diverse voices + transcripts.
* **TED-LIUM** → TED talk recordings + transcripts.

Each dataset typically provides:

| Audio File Name | Transcript Text           |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `0001.wav`      | “the quick brown fox”     |
| `0002.wav`      | “jumps over the lazy dog” |

---

### 🛠 **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

---

#### 1️⃣ **Audio preprocessing**

We **do not feed raw waveforms directly** into RNNs. Instead, we convert them into features:

✅ **Mel spectrogram** → A time-frequency representation capturing sound energy at different frequencies.

✅ **MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)** → Widely used compact features representing human-perceived sound patterns.

The result is a **2D matrix**: time steps × feature dimensions.

Example:

* Audio clip → 100 time frames × 40 MFCC features.

---

#### 2️⃣ **Text preprocessing**

✅ Normalize transcripts:

* Lowercase everything.
* Remove punctuation (optional).
* Add special tokens (e.g., `<start>`, `<end>`).

✅ Tokenize characters or phonemes:

* Character-level → “hello” → `[h, e, l, l, o]`.
* Assign each character or phoneme an integer index.

---

#### 3️⃣ **Align inputs and targets**

* Inputs → Sequences of audio features (varying length).
* Targets → Sequences of token indices (also varying length).

Because audio and text lengths differ, we typically:

* Use **padding** or **masking**.
* Use specialized loss functions that handle sequence alignment.

---

### 🧠 **Step 3: Build the RNN Model**

---

The model generally has:

✅ **Input layer** → Accepts time series (e.g., MFCC features).

✅ **Stacked RNN layers** → LSTM or GRU layers that process the temporal dynamics of speech.

✅ **Dense + softmax output layer** → Predicts character or phoneme probabilities at each time step.

---

### 🏋 **Step 4: Define the Loss Function**

---

Here’s the critical part:

* In speech recognition, **input and target sequences are not necessarily aligned**.
* For example, one audio frame may map to zero or more characters.

✅ To handle this, we use:

### **CTC Loss (Connectionist Temporal Classification)**

---

### 🔍 **How Does CTC Loss Work?**

CTC loss allows:

* The model to **predict sequences without pre-aligned input-output pairs**.
* It internally handles blank labels and collapsing repeated predictions.

Example:

* Audio frames predict:

```
(blank) h h (blank) e (blank) l l o (blank)
```

* After collapsing → `hello`

✅ The loss compares all possible valid alignments between input predictions and the true target and computes:

$$
\text{CTC Loss} = -\log(\text{sum of probabilities of all valid alignments})
$$

This is very different from cross-entropy loss, which compares one-to-one token predictions.

---

### 🏃 **Step 5: Train the Model**

---

For each batch:

1. **Feed audio feature sequences** into the model.
2. **Model outputs** time-aligned softmax distributions over characters.
3. **CTC loss** is calculated between the output sequence and the true text transcript.
4. **Backpropagation** updates the RNN weights to improve alignment and character prediction.
5. **Repeat** over many batches and epochs.

Example:

| Epoch | Training Loss (CTC) | Validation Loss |
| ----- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | 120.5               | 135.2           |
| 5     | 80.2                | 95.4            |
| 10    | 60.8                | 75.3            |

---

### ✨ **Step 6: Decode Predictions**

---

After training:

✅ We take the raw predictions (character probabilities over time).

✅ Use **beam search** or **greedy decoding** to find the most likely output sequence.

CTC decoding:

* Collapses repeated predictions.
* Removes blank labels.
* Produces clean final transcriptions.

---

### 📊 **Step 7: Evaluate the Model**

---

✅ **Metrics**

* **Character Error Rate (CER)** → % of incorrect characters.
* **Word Error Rate (WER)** → % of incorrect words.

✅ **Evaluation steps**

* Run predictions on a test set.
* Compare predicted transcripts to ground-truth text.
* Analyze common mistakes (mispronunciations, accents, background noise).
