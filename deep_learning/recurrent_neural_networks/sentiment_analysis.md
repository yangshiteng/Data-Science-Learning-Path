## üß† **What Is Sentiment Analysis?**

**Sentiment Analysis** is the task of identifying the **emotional tone or opinion** expressed in a piece of text.

### üéØ Objective:

Classify a sentence, paragraph, or document into **sentiment categories**, such as:

* **Positive**
* **Negative**
* **Neutral**

### üìù Example:

| Input Text                          | Sentiment |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| "I love this movie!"                | Positive  |
| "This is the worst day ever."       | Negative  |
| "It's okay, not great but not bad." | Neutral   |

## üîÅ **Why Use RNNs for Sentiment Analysis?**

RNNs are well-suited for sentiment analysis because:

* **Text is sequential**: The meaning of a sentence depends on word order.
* RNNs **remember previous words** and update context as new words come in.
* Unlike bag-of-words models, RNNs **capture dependencies** (e.g., ‚Äúnot good‚Äù ‚â† ‚Äúgood‚Äù).

## üß± **Model Architecture**

A typical RNN-based sentiment analysis model has these layers:

1. **Embedding Layer**

   * Converts each word into a dense vector (embedding).
   * Helps the model understand semantic similarity between words.

2. **RNN Layer (LSTM/GRU)**

   * Processes the text one word at a time.
   * Maintains a **hidden state** that captures the context and builds up the meaning of the sequence.

3. **Dense + Softmax Layer**

   * Maps the final hidden state to output probabilities for sentiment classes.

## üîÅ **How the Training Works**

### üßæ Example Sentence:

> "The product is absolutely fantastic."

### Step-by-step:

1. **Tokenization**:

   * Split sentence into words: `["the", "product", "is", "absolutely", "fantastic"]`

2. **Embedding**:

   * Each word is turned into a vector using a word embedding (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec, or learned embeddings).

3. **RNN Encoding**:

   * The RNN processes each word one at a time, updating its hidden state.

4. **Final Hidden State**:

   * The final hidden state contains the **contextual representation** of the whole sentence.

5. **Output Layer**:

   * The hidden state is passed through a dense layer + softmax to predict:

     * Positive: 0.95
     * Neutral: 0.03
     * Negative: 0.02

6. **Loss & Backpropagation**:

   * Compute **cross-entropy loss** between predicted and true label.
   * Update model weights to improve accuracy.

## üìö **Training Dataset Example**

| Sentence                             | Label    |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| "I love this phone!"                 | Positive |
| "The service was terrible."          | Negative |
| "It‚Äôs just okay, nothing special."   | Neutral  |
| "Absolutely fantastic experience!"   | Positive |
| "I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone." | Negative |

> Labels are typically one-hot encoded:
> e.g., `Positive` = \[1, 0, 0], `Negative` = \[0, 1, 0], `Neutral` = \[0, 0, 1]

## üéØ **Loss Function and Optimization**

* **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
* **Optimizer**: Adam, SGD, or RMSprop
* Model is trained over many **epochs** using batches of examples.

## üìä **Evaluation Metrics**

| Metric               | Description                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**         | % of correct predictions            |
| **Precision/Recall** | Especially for imbalanced data      |
| **F1 Score**         | Harmonic mean of precision & recall |
| **Confusion Matrix** | Breakdown of TP, FP, FN, TN         |

---

## üß† **Advanced Techniques**

* **Bidirectional RNNs**: See both past and future context in the sentence.
* **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on important words (e.g., "love", "hate").
* **Pretrained Embeddings**: Use GloVe or fastText for better performance.
* **Hybrid with CNNs**: For capturing local patterns in text (n-grams).
