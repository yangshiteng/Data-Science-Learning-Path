# 📍 **Pointer Networks (Ptr-Net)**

---

## 📘 **What Are Pointer Networks?**

**Pointer Networks** are a neural architecture introduced by Vinyals et al. (2015) to model problems where the **output is a sequence of positions (or indices) from the input**.

They are especially useful when:

* The **output vocabulary size depends on the input length**
* The model needs to **select elements directly from the input**

---

## 🧠 **Why Are Pointer Networks Needed?**

Traditional Seq2Seq models use a **fixed-size output vocabulary**, making them unsuitable for tasks like:

* **Sorting**
* **Convex hull computation**
* **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
* **Text span extraction** (e.g., in QA)

These tasks require the model to **point to** or **choose positions** in the input — not generate new tokens.

---

## 🔧 **Core Idea**

Pointer Networks **replace the decoder’s softmax layer** with an **attention mechanism** that selects from the input elements:

* At each decoding step, instead of generating a token from a vocabulary:

  * The decoder computes attention over **encoder outputs**
  * The attention weights **define a distribution over input positions**
  * The most probable position is **“pointed to”** as the output

## 🧮 **Scoring Functions**

Pointer Networks often use:

* **Dot-product**: $e_{t,i} = s_t^\top h_i$
* **Additive attention**: $e_{t,i} = v^\top \tanh(W_1 s_t + W_2 h_i)$

These define how much attention the decoder gives to each encoder state.

## 📦 **Example Applications**

| Task                       | Why Pointer Networks?                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Sorting**                | Output is a permutation of input indices        |
| **Convex hull**            | Output is a subset of input points              |
| **TSP**                    | Output is an ordered list of cities (inputs)    |
| **Machine Reading QA**     | Point to start/end index in passage             |
| **Span prediction in NLP** | Model selects spans instead of generating words |

## 🚧 **Limitations**

| Limitation                      | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Requires discrete input mapping | Can't generate novel outputs          |
| Slower for long inputs          | Attention scales with input length    |
| Often task-specific             | Needs careful design for new problems |

---

## 🔧 Training Pointer Networks

* Trained using **cross-entropy loss** over the index-level output
* At each time step, supervise the model to point to the correct input position
