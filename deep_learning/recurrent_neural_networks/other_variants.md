## ðŸ”¬ **Other Variants of RNN Cells**

### 1. ðŸ§  **Minimal Gated Unit (MGU)**

* **Simplified version of GRU**
* Uses **only one gate** (update gate)
* Reduces computational load further than GRU

âœ… *Use when memory is limited or for very large datasets.*

---

### 2. ðŸ”„ **Independently Recurrent Neural Networks (IndRNN)**

* Each neuron has **its own recurrence**, i.e., the hidden state update is **element-wise**, not matrix-based.
* Enables deeper RNNs and better gradient flow.

#### Key idea:

$$
h_t^{(i)} = \sigma(W x_t + u^{(i)} h_{t-1}^{(i)})
$$

âœ… *Supports deep RNN stacks and long sequences.*

### 3. ðŸ“¦ **Unitary/Orthogonal RNNs**

* Use **unitary or orthogonal matrices** for recurrent weights.
* Designed to **preserve gradient norm** over long time steps (solving vanishing/exploding gradient problems).

Examples:

* uRNN (Unitary RNN)
* EURNN (Efficient Unitary RNN)

âœ… *Useful in audio, music, and physics modeling where long-term stability matters.*

---

### 4. âš¡ **Skip RNN / Clockwork RNN**

* Introduce **temporal sparsity** by **updating only parts** of the hidden state at a time or at **scheduled intervals**.
* More efficient for long sequences with **redundant frames** (e.g., video, time series).

âœ… *Improves speed and efficiency when not all time steps are equally important.*

---

### 5. ðŸ§¬ **Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN)**

* Combines the **parallelism of CNNs** with **temporal modeling of RNNs**.
* Uses 1D convolutions + pooling instead of full recurrence.

âœ… *Much faster than LSTM/GRU, ideal for GPUs.*

---

### 6. ðŸ§  **JANET (Just Another NET)**

* A minimal LSTM variant with **only the forget gate**.
* Still retains memory gating, but simplified for faster convergence.

---

### 7. ðŸŒ€ **Delta-RNN / Fast Weights RNNs**

* Introduce **second-order updates** or **fast weights** that learn rapidly changing short-term associations.
* Inspired by cognitive theories of working memory.

âœ… *Used in low-latency systems and memory-constrained tasks.*
