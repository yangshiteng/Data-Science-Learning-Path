## ✂️📉 **Gradient Clipping**

### 🧠 **What Is Gradient Clipping?**

**Gradient Clipping** is a technique used to **prevent exploding gradients** during training, especially in models like **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **LSTMs**, and **deep neural networks**.

It works by **limiting (clipping)** the size (norm) of the gradients **before updating weights**, ensuring that gradients don’t grow too large and destabilize the learning process.

---

### 🔥 Why Do We Need It?

During training — especially with **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)** — gradients can sometimes become very large.

#### 💥 What happens when gradients explode?

* The model **updates weights too drastically**
* The **loss spikes** or becomes **NaN**
* Training becomes unstable or diverges completely

## 🛠️ **How Gradient Clipping Works**

### 🧾 Clipping by Norm (most common):

Let $\|\nabla\|$ be the total norm of all gradients.

If $\|\nabla\| > \text{threshold}$, then scale all gradients:

$$
\nabla \leftarrow \frac{\text{threshold}}{\|\nabla\|} \cdot \nabla
$$

This ensures the **overall size of the gradient vector** is below a safe threshold.

---

### 💡 Analogy:

Imagine gradients as speed — if a car is going 300 km/h toward a cliff (unstable training), clipping is like **slamming the brakes** to cap the max speed to a safer limit, say 80 km/h.

---

### 🔧 Implementation Example (PyTorch):

```python
# Before optimizer.step()
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
optimizer.step()
```

Or in TensorFlow:

```python
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0)
```

## 📊 When to Use Gradient Clipping

✅ Use it when:

* You're training **RNNs, LSTMs, or GRUs**
* You're using **deep networks** (many layers)
* You observe **loss instability**, or gradients exploding
