## 🧮 **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**

### 🔍 **1. What Is BPTT?**

**Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)** is the extension of the standard **backpropagation** algorithm, tailored specifically for training **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.
Because RNNs unfold over time, BPTT must also **backpropagate errors through multiple time steps**, not just layers—hence the name.

📌 **Goal**: Adjust weights by computing gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter, considering the network's entire temporal structure.

### 🧠 **2. Why It’s Different from Standard Backprop**

In a regular neural network:

* You move forward through layers 🧱
* Then backpropagate errors layer by layer

In an RNN:

* You move forward through **time steps** ⏩
* Then backpropagate through time 🔁—because each hidden state depends on previous ones

---

### 📐 **3. How BPTT Works**

Let’s say you have a sequence $x_1, x_2, ..., x_T$ with corresponding outputs $y_1, y_2, ..., y_T$ and total loss $L$ defined as:

$$
L = \sum_{t=1}^T \ell(y_t, \hat{y}_t)
$$

Then BPTT involves:

1. **Forward Pass** (as covered earlier):

   * Compute all hidden states $h_1, ..., h_T$
   * Compute predictions $\hat{y}_t$ and losses

2. **Backward Pass**:

   * Start at the final time step $T$
   * Compute gradients $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}$, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t}$, etc.
   * Accumulate gradients **through time** back to $t=1$

✏️ **Each weight** (e.g., $W_{hh}$) receives **a sum of gradients** from each time step where it was used.

### ⚠️ **4. Challenges in BPTT**

While BPTT is powerful, it comes with issues:

* 📉 **Vanishing Gradients**: Gradients become very small over long sequences → makes learning long-term dependencies hard.
* 📈 **Exploding Gradients**: Gradients grow exponentially → can destabilize training.

🛡️ **Solutions**:

* Gradient clipping ✂️
* Using better architectures: **LSTM** and **GRU** are designed to mitigate these issues

### 🧮 **5. Truncated BPTT**

For long sequences, computing gradients over all time steps is computationally expensive.

⏳ **Truncated BPTT** addresses this by:

* Dividing the sequence into shorter chunks (e.g., 5–20 steps)
* Backpropagating only within each chunk

This reduces computation while still capturing local dependencies.
