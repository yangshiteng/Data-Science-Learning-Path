## üèó **Complete Training Process: Sentiment Analysis Using RNNs**

---

### üåç **Objective**

We want to train a model that takes in a text (like a movie review) and outputs whether the **sentiment** is positive, negative, or neutral.

For example:

> Review: ‚ÄúI absolutely loved this movie!‚Äù ‚Üí Sentiment: Positive
> Review: ‚ÄúIt was boring and predictable.‚Äù ‚Üí Sentiment: Negative

This is a **text classification task**, where the input is a sequence (words or characters), and the output is a sentiment label.

---

---

### üõ† **Step 1: Training Dataset**

---

‚úÖ **Real-world datasets** often used:

* **IMDb Reviews** ‚Üí Movie reviews labeled as positive/negative.
* **Yelp Reviews** ‚Üí Business reviews labeled by star ratings.
* **Amazon Product Reviews** ‚Üí Product reviews with satisfaction labels.
* **Twitter Sentiment140** ‚Üí Tweets labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

---

‚úÖ **What does the dataset look like?**

| Text Sample                            | Sentiment Label |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| ‚ÄúThis film was amazing, I was hooked!‚Äù | Positive        |
| ‚ÄúTerrible acting and bad script.‚Äù      | Negative        |
| ‚ÄúThe product works as expected.‚Äù       | Neutral         |

We typically get:

* A large set of **text samples**.
* Corresponding **labels** (often binary or multiclass).

---

---

### üõ† **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

---

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clean the text**

* Lowercase everything.
* Remove punctuation, special characters, and extra spaces.
* Optionally remove stopwords (common words like ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúis‚Äù) or apply stemming/lemmatization.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Tokenize the text**

* Build a **vocabulary** of the most common words (e.g., top 10,000 words).
* Convert each text into a sequence of integer word indices.

Example:

* ‚ÄúI loved the movie‚Äù ‚Üí \[12, 453, 7, 89]

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Pad or truncate sequences**

Because RNNs require **fixed-length inputs** in batches, we:

* Pad shorter sequences with zeros (or another special token).
* Truncate longer sequences to a maximum length.

Example (max length = 6):
\| Original ‚Üí \[12, 453, 7, 89] ‚Üí Padded ‚Üí \[0, 0, 12, 453, 7, 89] |

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Encode the labels**

* For binary classification (positive/negative), use labels like 0 or 1.
* For multiclass, convert to integer indices or one-hot vectors.

---

---

### üß† **Step 3: Build the RNN Model**

---

The typical architecture is:

‚úÖ **Embedding Layer** ‚Üí Converts word indices into dense word vectors (learned or pre-trained).

‚úÖ **RNN Layer (LSTM or GRU)** ‚Üí Processes the sequence, capturing dependencies across time.

‚úÖ **Dense Layer + Softmax (or Sigmoid)** ‚Üí Maps the final hidden states to output sentiment probabilities.

Example:

* Input: Padded sequence ‚Üí Embedding ‚Üí LSTM ‚Üí Dense ‚Üí Positive/Negative

---

---

### üèã **Step 4: Define the Loss Function**

---

‚úÖ **Binary classification (positive/negative)**:

* Use **binary cross-entropy loss**:

$$
\text{Loss} = - [y \cdot \log(p) + (1 - y) \cdot \log(1 - p)]
$$

where:

* $y$ = true label (0 or 1)
* $p$ = predicted probability for positive

‚úÖ **Multiclass classification (positive/neutral/negative)**:

* Use **categorical cross-entropy loss**:

$$
\text{Loss} = - \sum_{c} y_c \log(p_c)
$$

where:

* $y_c$ = true label (one-hot) for class $c$
* $p_c$ = predicted probability for class $c$

‚úÖ **Why this loss?**

* It measures how well the predicted probabilities match the true labels.
* Lower loss = better predictions.

---

---

### üèÉ **Step 5: Train the Model**

---

For each epoch:

1. Feed in a batch of padded sequences and their labels.
2. Run forward pass through the model to get predictions.
3. Compute the loss between predictions and true labels.
4. Backpropagate the loss to update the model‚Äôs weights.
5. Repeat over all batches.

Example:

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Accuracy |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 1     | 0.65          | 72%                 |
| 5     | 0.45          | 82%                 |
| 10    | 0.32          | 85%                 |

---

---

### ‚ú® **Step 6: Evaluate the Model**

---

‚úÖ **Evaluation metrics**:

* **Accuracy** ‚Üí Percentage of correct predictions.
* **Precision/Recall/F1** ‚Üí Useful for imbalanced datasets.
* **Confusion Matrix** ‚Üí Shows how often each class is predicted correctly.

‚úÖ **Check on a test set**:

* Feed in unseen samples.
* Compare predictions to true labels.
* Analyze performance and common errors.

‚úÖ Analyzing customer feedback on products or services.

‚úÖ Monitoring public sentiment on social media.

‚úÖ Enhancing recommendation systems (e.g., based on positive reviews).

‚úÖ Supporting brand reputation tracking and market analysis.

### ‚öô **Common Challenges**

| Challenge               | Solutions                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Long-range dependencies | Use LSTM or GRU instead of vanilla RNN.                           |
| Rare/unknown words      | Apply subword tokenization (BPE, WordPiece) or add `<unk>` token. |
| Imbalanced datasets     | Use weighted loss or oversample minority class.                   |
| Overfitting             | Apply dropout, early stopping, or regularization.                 |
