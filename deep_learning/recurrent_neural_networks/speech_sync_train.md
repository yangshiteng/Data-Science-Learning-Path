## üéØ Objective:

Given an input sentence like:

> `"Good morning, everyone!"`

The system should synthesize a realistic human-like speech waveform that says it.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Step 1: Training Dataset

You need a **paired dataset** of:

* **Text**: The sentence to be spoken.
* **Audio**: The corresponding speech waveform.

### üì¶ Example Datasets:

| Dataset      | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **LJSpeech** | \~13,100 English sentences by a female speaker. |
| **Blizzard** | Long-form readings from literature.             |
| **VCTK**     | Multispeaker English dataset with accents.      |

Each dataset typically includes:

* A `.wav` file (16 kHz mono) for each sentence
* A `.txt` file or metadata CSV with matching transcriptions

---

## üßπ Step 2: Data Preprocessing

### 2.1 Text Preprocessing

Convert raw sentences into structured input:

* **Normalization**: Remove symbols, expand abbreviations

  * `"Dr." ‚Üí "Doctor"`
* **Phoneme Conversion** (optional): e.g., `"Hello"` ‚Üí `[HH, EH, L, OW]`
* **Tokenization/Encoding**:

  * Map characters or phonemes to IDs

### 2.2 Audio Preprocessing

Extract **acoustic features** from the waveform:

* Common features: **Mel-spectrograms**, **MFCCs**, or **log-mel**
* Typical config:

  * Window size: 50 ms
  * Hop size: 12.5 ms
  * Feature dimension: 80
* Normalize features (e.g., mean-variance normalization)

Each audio file becomes a 2D matrix:

```
[frame_1, frame_2, ..., frame_T]  where each frame is a vector of mel coefficients
```

---

## üì• Step 3: Model Input and Output

### Input to the Model:

* Sequence of token IDs (characters or phonemes)

  * Example: `["H", "E", "L", "L", "O"]` ‚Üí `[17, 6, 12, 12, 15]`
* Optionally, duration and pitch information (if using prosody)

### Output from the Model:

* Frame-by-frame acoustic features:

  * Example: a sequence of 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram vectors
  * Shape: `(num_frames, feature_dim)`, e.g., `(200, 80)`

---

## üß† Step 4: RNN-Based Model Architecture

### Common architecture (like Tacotron 1):

1. **Encoder**:

   * Embeds input tokens
   * BiLSTM layers encode sequential structure

2. **Attention Mechanism**:

   * Learns alignment between input text and audio frames
   * Ensures that audio output matches the progression of text

3. **Decoder (RNN)**:

   * Autoregressively generates acoustic frames
   * LSTM predicts one frame at a time based on previous output

---

## üßÆ Step 5: Loss Calculation

### Acoustic Feature Loss (main component):

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** or **L1 Loss** between predicted and target mel-spectrogram:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{mel} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \| \hat{y}_t - y_t \|^2
$$

Where:

* $\hat{y}_t$: predicted mel-spectrogram at frame $t$
* $y_t$: ground-truth frame

### Optional auxiliary losses:

* **Stop token loss**: Binary cross-entropy to predict when to stop generation
* **Duration loss** (in non-attentive models)

---

## üèãÔ∏è Step 6: Training Process

1. Sample a batch of `(text_input, spectrogram_target)` pairs
2. Pass text input through the encoder
3. Decoder generates acoustic frames one by one
4. Calculate loss between predicted and real spectrogram frames
5. Use Adam or similar optimizer to update model weights
6. Repeat over many epochs until the model produces clear speech patterns

---

## üîä Step 7: Vocoder Inference (Post-processing)

The RNN only generates **spectrogram features**, not the actual audio.

To get the waveform:

* Feed predicted spectrogram into a **vocoder** model:

  * Examples: **Griffin-Lim**, **WaveNet**, **WaveGlow**, **HiFi-GAN**

This step transforms the visual spectrogram representation into real audible sound.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
