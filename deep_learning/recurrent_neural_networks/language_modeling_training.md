### 🌍 **Example: Training an RNN Language Model on Song Lyrics**

Let’s say you want to train a model on a dataset of song lyrics to **generate new lyrics**.

---

---

### 📦 **Step 1: Choose Your Dataset**

We need a dataset.
For example, let’s use **Taylor Swift lyrics** collected from online sources.

We combine all her song lyrics into one big text file.

---

Example snippet:

```
Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
```

---

---

### 🛠 **Step 2: Preprocess the Data**

---

✅ **Tokenize the text**

Decide: do we want to model **character-level** or **word-level**?

* **Character-level**: Sequence → \['C', 'a', 'u', 's', 'e', ' ', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'y']
* **Word-level**: Sequence → \['Cause', 'baby', 'now', 'we', 'got', 'bad', 'blood']

For this example, let’s do **word-level**.

---

✅ **Build vocabulary**

Extract all unique words and assign each one an index.

Example:

| Word    | Index |
| ------- | ----- |
| ‘Cause’ | 0     |
| ‘baby’  | 1     |
| ‘now’   | 2     |
| ‘we’    | 3     |
| ‘got’   | 4     |
| …       | …     |

Let’s say we have 10,000 unique words (vocabulary size).

---

✅ **Create input–target pairs**

We slide a **window** over the text.

For a window size of 5, example:

* Input: \[‘Cause’, ‘baby’, ‘now’, ‘we’, ‘got’] → Target: ‘bad’
* Input: \[‘baby’, ‘now’, ‘we’, ‘got’, ‘bad’] → Target: ‘blood’

This forms our training dataset.

---

---

### 🧠 **Step 3: Build the RNN Model**

---

✅ **Input layer**

* Convert word indices to dense vectors using an **embedding layer**.

For example, 10,000 vocab → 128-dimensional embeddings.

---

✅ **RNN layer**

* Use **LSTM** or **GRU** to process the input sequence.

Example:

```python
lstm = LSTM(256, return_sequences=False)
```

This outputs a hidden state summarizing the input sequence.

---

✅ **Output layer**

* Apply a **dense (fully connected) layer** + **softmax** to predict the next word.

Example:

```python
dense = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
```

---

✅ **Model summary**

```
Input (5 words) → Embedding → LSTM → Dense → Next word probability
```

---

---

### 🏋️ **Step 4: Define Loss Function and Optimizer**

---

✅ **Loss function**:
Use **categorical cross-entropy** (comparing predicted vs. actual next word).

✅ **Optimizer**:
Use **Adam** or **SGD** for efficient weight updates.

---

---

### 🔁 **Step 5: Train the Model**

We loop over the dataset for multiple **epochs**.

At each batch:

1. Forward pass:

   * Input → prediction (probabilities over next word).
2. Compute loss:

   * Compare prediction vs. true next word.
3. Backward pass:

   * Calculate gradients (using backpropagation through time, BPTT).
4. Update weights:

   * Apply optimizer to adjust model weights.

---

✅ **Epoch example**

| Epoch | Average Loss |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 1     | 3.2          |
| 5     | 2.1          |
| 10    | 1.4          |

As epochs go up, loss typically goes down — the model gets better at predicting.

---

---

### 📊 **Step 6: Evaluate the Model**

---

✅ **Quantitative metrics**

* **Perplexity** → Measures how well the model predicts unseen text (lower is better).

✅ **Qualitative check**

* Generate some **sample lyrics** and see if they look coherent.

---

---

### 🔮 **Step 7: Generate New Lyrics**

---

✅ **Sampling process (generation)**

1. Provide a starting seed: e.g., “baby now we”
2. Predict next word: model suggests ‘got’
3. Append: “baby now we got”
4. Feed back in: “now we got” → predict → ‘bad’
5. Append: “baby now we got bad”
6. Continue for N words to generate a whole line or verse.

---

✅ **Sampling methods**

* **Greedy search**: Always pick the top prediction.
* **Top-k sampling**: Randomly sample from the top k predictions.
* **Temperature sampling**: Adjust randomness in predictions (higher temperature = more creative).

### ⚠️ **Step 8: Handle Challenges**

| Challenge                    | Solution                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Overfitting on training data | Use dropout or early stopping         |
| Vanishing gradients          | Use LSTM or GRU instead of simple RNN |
| Large vocabulary size        | Use techniques like sampled softmax   |
| Long-range dependencies      | Consider adding attention mechanisms  |
