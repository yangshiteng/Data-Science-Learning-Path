## 🏗 **Spelling & Grammar Correction with RNNs**

---

### 🌍 **What is the goal?**

The goal is to build a system that takes in **a possibly incorrect sentence** and outputs **the corrected version**.

Example:

❌ Input: “He go to school every day.”

✅ Output: “He goes to school every day.”

Or:

❌ Input: “I recieve teh package yestarday.”

✅ Output: “I received the package yesterday.”

### ✨ **Why use RNNs?**

Spelling and grammar correction is a **sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)** task:

* Input: a sequence of tokens (characters or words).
* Output: a corrected sequence of tokens.

RNN-based models, especially encoder–decoder architectures, are well-suited for this because:

✅ They handle variable-length input and output.

✅ They maintain **context** across sequences, crucial for grammar.

✅ They can learn both **local patterns** (spelling errors) and **global structure** (grammar).

### 🏋 **High-Level Model Architecture**

---

✅ **Encoder**:

* Takes the input sequence (possibly with mistakes).
* Embeds tokens into dense vectors.
* Processes the sequence using RNN layers (often LSTM or GRU) to produce hidden states summarizing the meaning.

✅ **Decoder**:

* Takes the encoder’s hidden states.
* Generates the corrected sequence, one token at a time.
* Uses a softmax layer to predict the next most probable token.

✅ **Attention mechanism (optional but powerful)**:

* Lets the decoder **focus** on relevant parts of the input when generating each output token.
* Improves correction, especially for long or complex sentences.

### 🛠 **Training Dataset**

---

To train such a system, we need:
✅ **Pairs of incorrect and correct sentences**.

Sources can include:

* Manually crafted pairs (e.g., learner corpora like Lang-8).
* Synthetic data (introducing controlled mistakes into correct sentences).
* Datasets from grammar correction competitions (e.g., CoNLL-2014, BEA).

#### **Dataset format example**

| Input (incorrect)                | Target (corrected)                |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| “She dont like apples.”          | “She doesn’t like apples.”        |
| “We was waiting at the station.” | “We were waiting at the station.” |
| “I didn’t knew the answer.”      | “I didn’t know the answer.”       |

### 🏗 **Preprocessing Steps**

---

1️⃣ **Tokenization**

* Decide whether to use **character-level** or **word-level** tokens.
* Character-level handles spelling errors better; word-level captures grammar better.

2️⃣ **Vocabulary building**

* Create token-to-index mappings for both input and output.
* Handle rare or unknown words with an `<unk>` token.

3️⃣ **Padding and batching**

* Pad sequences to uniform lengths for efficient training.
* Group similar-length sentences into batches to speed up RNN computation.

### 🔍 **Loss Calculation**

---

✅ **What’s predicted?**
At each decoder time step, the model predicts the **next token** in the corrected sentence.

✅ **What’s the target?**
The correct token from the reference (corrected) sentence.

✅ **What’s the loss function?**

* **Categorical cross-entropy loss**:

$$
\text{Loss}_t = -\log(P(\text{correct token at step } t))
$$

✅ **Total loss**:

* Average (or sum) of per-step losses over the entire sequence.

✅ **Optimization**:

* The model updates its weights to **minimize this loss** over the training dataset.

### ✨ **Inference (Using the Trained Model)**

---

At test time, the system:

1. Takes a noisy input sentence.
2. Encodes it into hidden states.
3. Uses the decoder to generate the corrected sentence, one token at a time.
4. Optionally applies:

   * **Greedy decoding** → pick the most probable next token.
   * **Beam search** → explore multiple possible sequences.
   * **Temperature or top-k sampling** → add diversity or randomness.
