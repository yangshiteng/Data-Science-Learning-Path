## 🛠 **Full Training Process: Abstractive Text Summarization with RNNs**

---

### 🌍 **Goal**

We want to build a model that takes:

* **Input**: a long news article.
* **Output**: a short, human-like summary.

For example:

* Article → *“The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in Q1, driven by consumer spending…”*
* Summary → *“US economy expands 3.2% on consumer demand.”*

---

### 🏗 **Step 1: Load and Preprocess the Data**

---

1. **Load dataset**
   We use a large dataset like [CNN/DailyMail dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail), which provides thousands of article-summary pairs.

2. **Clean the text**

* Lowercase everything.
* Remove unwanted characters (HTML tags, symbols).
* Fix or remove rare or corrupted words.

3. **Tokenize the text**

* Build a word-level vocabulary (for example, the top 50,000 most frequent words).
* Map each word to a unique index:

  * “the” → 1
  * “economy” → 2
  * “grew” → 3
  * etc.

At this stage, tokenized sequences naturally have different lengths because articles and summaries vary.

4. **Pad or truncate sequences**
   To feed into the neural network, we pad all sequences to fixed maximum lengths.
   For example:

* Articles → pad to length 300.
* Summaries → pad to length 50.

Example:

| Original sequence | After padding (max len = 5) |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| \[2, 3]           | \[0, 0, 0, 2, 3]            |
| \[4, 5, 6, 7]     | \[0, 4, 5, 6, 7]         |

### 🧠 **Step 2: Build the Model**

---

1. **Encoder**

* Embedding layer → Converts article word indices to dense vectors.
* Bidirectional LSTM → Processes the entire article and produces hidden states that summarize the input.

2. **Decoder**

* Embedding layer → Converts the summary input words (during training) into dense vectors.
* LSTM → Generates the summary step by step, conditioned on the encoder’s context.
* Dense + softmax layer → Outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next word.

3. **Attention mechanism (optional but recommended)**

* Allows the decoder to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input article at each generation step, improving performance on longer texts.

---

### 🏋️ **Step 3: Train the Model**

---

For each batch in training:

1. **Feed input**

* Article → Encoder → Get hidden states.
* Summary start token + previous summary tokens → Decoder → Predict next word.

2. **Make predictions**

* At each time step, the decoder outputs a softmax probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next word.

Example:
Given “US economy expands”, the model predicts:

| Word     | Probability |
| -------- | ----------- |
| “3%”     | 0.60        |
| “on”     | 0.20        |
| “stocks” | 0.10        |
| ...      | ...         |

3. **Calculate loss**
   At each decoder time step, we compute:

$$
\text{Loss}_t = -\log(\text{Predicted probability of true next word})
$$

For the overall sequence, we average (or sum) the losses across all time steps:

$$
\text{Total Loss} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \text{Loss}_t
$$

where $T$ is the summary length.

This is called **categorical cross-entropy loss**, which encourages the model to assign higher probabilities to the correct next words.

4. **Backpropagate and update weights**
   Using backpropagation through time (BPTT), we compute gradients and update the encoder and decoder weights to minimize the loss.

5. **Repeat for multiple epochs**
   Over time, the model improves as the loss decreases.

Example training progress:

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | 2.45          | 2.70            |
| 5     | 1.85          | 2.10            |
| 10    | 1.50          | 1.85            |

### ✨ **Step 4: Generate Summaries**

---

After training, we can generate summaries for new articles.

1. Feed the article into the encoder.
2. Start the decoder with a `<start>` token.
3. Predict the next word.
4. Feed the predicted word back into the decoder.
5. Repeat until the model outputs an `<end>` token or reaches the maximum summary length.

---

**Sampling methods**:

* **Greedy decoding** → Always pick the most probable word.
* **Beam search** → Keep the top N most promising sequences at each step.
* **Top-k or nucleus sampling** → Randomly sample from the top-k predictions for more diversity.

---

### 📊 **Step 5: Evaluate the Model**

---

1. **Quantitative evaluation**

* **ROUGE scores** → Measure overlap between generated and reference summaries (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L).
* **BLEU score** → Measures n-gram precision, often used in machine translation.

2. **Qualitative evaluation**

* Read the generated summaries and check for:

  * Fluency.
  * Coherence.
  * Factual accuracy.
  * Avoidance of repetition or irrelevant details.

---

### 🚀 **Step 6: Improve the Model**

---

Common improvements include:

* **Pointer-generator networks** → Combine copying from the input (extractive) with generating new words (abstractive).
* **Coverage mechanisms** → Reduce repetitive phrases.
* **Hierarchical encoders** → Handle longer documents by modeling sentences and paragraphs.
* **Transformer models** → Use architectures like BART or T5, which outperform RNNs on summarization benchmarks.
