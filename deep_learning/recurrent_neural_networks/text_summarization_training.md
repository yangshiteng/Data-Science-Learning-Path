## 🛠 **Full Training Process: Abstractive Summarization with RNNs**

---

### 🌍 **Real-World Example**

Let’s say we want to **summarize news articles** from the [CNN/DailyMail dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail), which contains thousands of news articles and their human-written summaries (highlights).

Our goal is to train a model that, given a news article, can **generate a short summary** in its own words.

---

### 🏗 **Step 1: Load and Prepare the Dataset**

---

✅ **Data example**

* **Input (article)**:
  “The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the first quarter, driven by strong consumer spending and exports…”

* **Target (summary)**:
  “US economy expands 3.2% on consumer spending, exports.”

---

✅ **Preprocessing steps**

1. **Clean the text** → Remove non-printable characters, extra spaces, or special tokens.
2. **Tokenize** → Convert text into sequences of word indices.
3. **Build vocabulary** → Keep the top N most frequent words (e.g., 50,000) and assign them unique indices.
4. **Pad sequences** → Pad or truncate input and summary sequences to fixed lengths.

Example:

| Text                  | After tokenization (indices) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| “The US economy grew” | \[10, 25, 784, 921]          |
| “US economy expands”  | \[25, 784, 1632]             |

### 🧩 **Step 2: Define the Model Architecture**

We build an **encoder–decoder model** with attention.

---

✅ **Encoder**

* Embedding layer → Converts word indices to dense vectors.
* Bidirectional LSTM → Processes the article, producing hidden states.

✅ **Decoder**

* Embedding layer → Converts summary tokens (during training) to dense vectors.
* LSTM → Generates the summary, conditioned on the encoder’s context.
* Dense + softmax layer → Outputs a probability distribution over the next summary word.

✅ **Attention mechanism**

* Helps the decoder **focus on relevant parts** of the input at each step, instead of compressing everything into one context vector.

---

### 🔍 **Step 3: Define Loss and Optimizer**

---

✅ **Loss**

* Use **categorical cross-entropy** comparing the predicted summary word probabilities to the true next words.

✅ **Optimizer**

* Use **Adam optimizer** for stable, adaptive learning.

✅ **Additional tricks**

* Use **teacher forcing** → During training, feed the decoder the **true previous summary word** (not the predicted one) to speed up learning.

---

### 🏋️ **Step 4: Train the Model**

---

For each training step:

1. Feed the **input article** through the encoder → get context vectors.
2. Feed the **summary tokens (so far)** + context into the decoder → get predicted next word.
3. Compute the **loss** between predicted and true summary word.
4. **Backpropagate** the error → update the weights.
5. Repeat over many epochs.

---

✅ **Epoch progress**

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | 2.45          | 2.60            |
| 5     | 1.85          | 2.10            |
| 10    | 1.50          | 1.90            |

---

### ✨ **Step 5: Generate Summaries**

---

After training, we **generate new summaries** by:

1. Feeding an article into the encoder.
2. Starting the decoder with a `<start>` token.
3. Predicting the next word.
4. Feeding the predicted word back into the decoder.
5. Repeating until we produce the `<end>` token or hit the maximum length.

✅ **Sampling methods**

* **Greedy decoding** → Always pick the most probable word.
* **Beam search** → Keep top N most promising hypotheses at each step.
* **Top-k or nucleus sampling** → Introduce controlled randomness for diversity.

---

### ⚠ **Step 6: Evaluate the Model**

---

✅ **Quantitative metrics**

* **ROUGE scores** → Measure overlap between generated and reference summaries (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L).
* **BLEU scores** → Measure n-gram precision.

✅ **Qualitative check**

* Manually inspect generated summaries for fluency, coherence, and factual accuracy.

### 🛠 **Step 7: Fine-tune and Improve**

---

| Challenge              | Solution                                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repetitive summaries   | Add coverage mechanism or penalize repeats.              |
| Factual errors         | Use pointer-generator networks to copy factual details.  |
| Long document handling | Use hierarchical encoders (sentence-level + word-level). |
| Slow training          | Switch to Transformer-based models (e.g., BART, T5).     |

| Dataset       | Load articles + summaries (e.g., CNN/DailyMail)                     |
| Preprocessing | Clean, tokenize, build vocab, pad sequences                         |
| Model         | Build encoder–decoder RNN (LSTM/GRU) + attention                    |
| Training      | Feed inputs, compute loss, backpropagate, update weights            |
| Generation    | Predict summary using greedy decoding, beam search, or sampling     |
| Evaluation    | Measure ROUGE/BLEU scores, manually inspect outputs                 |
| Improvements  | Add advanced mechanisms (coverage, pointer-generator, Transformers) |
