## ⚙️ **Optimizers for RNNs**

### 🧠 What Is an Optimizer?

An **optimizer** is the algorithm used to **update the weights** of a neural network during training, based on the gradients calculated from the loss.
In the case of **RNNs**, optimizers must deal with challenges like:

* **Vanishing or exploding gradients**
* **Sequential dependencies**
* **Long-term memory learning**

Choosing the right optimizer is crucial for stable and efficient RNN training.

## 🔄 Commonly Used Optimizers for RNNs

### 1. 🧮 **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**

#### 🔧 How It Works:

SGD updates weights using a simple rule:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}
$$

Where:

* $\theta$: model parameters
* $\eta$: learning rate
* $\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$: gradient of the loss

#### ✅ Pros:

* Simple and interpretable
* Performs well with proper tuning and momentum
* Can generalize better in some cases

#### ❌ Cons:

* Requires careful learning rate tuning
* Can converge slowly
* Sensitive to exploding/vanishing gradients

#### 🧠 Tip:

Use **momentum** or **learning rate decay**, and always combine with **gradient clipping** when training RNNs.

### 2. ⚡ **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**

#### 🔧 How It Works:

Adam maintains:

* An exponentially decaying **average of past gradients** (momentum)
* An exponentially decaying **average of past squared gradients**

It adapts learning rates for each parameter individually:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \frac{m_t}{\sqrt{v_t} + \epsilon}
$$

Where:

* $m_t$: moving average of gradients
* $v_t$: moving average of squared gradients
* $\epsilon$: small constant for stability

#### ✅ Pros:

* Fast convergence
* Requires little tuning
* Handles sparse or noisy gradients well
* Great for complex architectures like LSTMs/GRUs

#### ❌ Cons:

* Can sometimes generalize worse than SGD
* More computationally intensive

#### 🧠 Tip:

Adam is a strong default choice for training RNNs, especially on large or noisy datasets.

### 3. 💡 **RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation)**

#### 🔧 How It Works:

RMSprop scales the learning rate by dividing by a moving average of squared gradients:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{v_t + \epsilon}} \cdot \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}
$$

Where:

* $v_t$: running average of squared gradients
* Helps normalize updates for each parameter

#### ✅ Pros:

* Effective for **non-stationary objectives** (e.g., time-series)
* Often outperforms SGD in RNNs
* Less complex than Adam but still adaptive

#### ❌ Cons:

* Doesn’t use momentum by default
* Learning rate still needs tuning

#### 🧠 Tip:

RMSprop is particularly good for **sequential data and time-dependent tasks** — a classic choice for early RNN models.

| SGD       | Fixed LR            | Simple, robust with tuning          | Slow, sensitive to LR             | Small/simple RNNs        |
| Adam      | Adaptive + Momentum | Fast, minimal tuning, handles noise | Slightly heavier, risk of overfit | Deep RNNs, LSTM/GRU      |
| RMSprop   | Adaptive            | Lightweight, great for RNNs         | No momentum, LR tuning needed     | Time series, speech, NLP |

## 🔐 Final Tips for RNN Training

* Always combine **gradient clipping** with any optimizer to prevent exploding gradients.
* **Adam** is usually the best starting point.
* For long sequences or noisy data, **RMSprop** can perform better than SGD.
