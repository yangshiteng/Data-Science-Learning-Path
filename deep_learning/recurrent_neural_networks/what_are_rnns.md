## 📘 What are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)?

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are a type of neural network designed to handle **sequential data**. This includes any data where the order of the elements matters—like text, speech, time-series data, and video frames.

The key idea behind RNNs is to use the output from the previous step as an input to the current step. This gives the network a kind of **memory**, allowing it to retain context across time.

An RNN has a loop-like architecture that allows information to persist. At each time step, the network takes an input and updates its hidden state, which acts like a memory summarizing past inputs. This hidden state is passed from one time step to the next, allowing the network to maintain context across a sequence. The core idea is that the same set of weights is reused across all time steps, which helps generalize well over varying sequence lengths.

## 🔄 How RNNs Work: The Core Concept

### Traditional Neural Networks vs RNNs

* A **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** processes input independently—no memory of past inputs.
* An **RNN** has loops in its architecture, allowing it to pass information from one step to the next.

Traditional feedforward neural networks, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), excel at handling fixed-size input and output data. However, they struggle with sequential data where the order and context of inputs are crucial—for instance, in time series forecasting, speech recognition, or natural language processing (NLP). These tasks require memory of previous inputs, which traditional models lack. RNNs are designed to address this limitation by incorporating a form of memory, enabling them to capture temporal dependencies and sequence patterns.

### RNN Cell Structure

At each time step `t`, the RNN receives:

* Input vector `xₜ`
* Previous hidden state `hₜ₋₁` (memory)

It outputs:

* New hidden state `hₜ`

**Mathematically:**

$$
h_t = \tanh(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)
$$

$$
y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y
$$

Where:

* `W_{hh}`, `W_{xh}`, `W_{hy}` are weight matrices
* `b_h`, `b_y` are bias terms
* `tanh` is an activation function introducing non-linearity

#### 🔄 **1. Folded View (Left Side)**

This shows a **single RNN cell** with loops representing **recurrence**. It receives:

* **Input $x$** (green circle)
* **Hidden state $h$** from the previous time step (blue box)
* And it produces:

  * A **new hidden state**
  * An **output $o$** (pink circle)

Arrows and Matrices:

* **U**: Weight matrix from input $x$ to hidden state $h$
* **V**: Weight matrix from hidden state $h$ to output $o$
* **W**: Weight matrix for the recurrent connection (from previous $h$ to current $h$)

This compact view summarizes the inner logic of the RNN.

#### 📆 **2. Unfolded View (Right Side)**

The large arrow shows how the single RNN cell is **unfolded over time**. Each RNN cell (blue box) represents the **same RNN unit with shared weights** at different time steps $t-1$, $t$, and $t+1$.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

| Time Step | Input     | Hidden State | Output    |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- |
| $t-1$     | $x_{t-1}$ | $h_{t-1}$    | $o_{t-1}$ |
| $t$       | $x_t$     | $h_t$        | $o_t$     |
| $t+1$     | $x_{t+1}$ | $h_{t+1}$    | $o_{t+1}$ |

Each step:

1. Takes the current input $x_t$
2. Combines it with the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$
3. Computes a new hidden state $h_t$
4. Produces an output $o_t$

## 🔁 Sequence Processing in RNNs

Suppose you’re processing the sentence “I love AI” word by word:

1. First word: input “I” → output and update memory
2. Second word: input “love” + memory from “I”
3. Third word: input “AI” + memory from “love”

This memory mechanism makes RNNs powerful for context-aware tasks.

## 🧠 Variants of RNNs

Due to the limitations of simple RNNs, several improved architectures were developed:

### 1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

* Introduced memory cells and gates (input, output, forget) to combat vanishing gradients.
* Better at learning **long-term dependencies**.

### 2. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**

* Similar to LSTM but with fewer gates (reset and update gates).
* Faster and computationally more efficient.
