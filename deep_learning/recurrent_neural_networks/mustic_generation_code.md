### 🛠 **Step 1: Import Libraries**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
```
✅ **Explanation:** We import TensorFlow, model layers, and utilities. We’ll use a simple sequential model for next-event prediction.

---

### 🛠 **Step 2: Prepare Example Data**

```python
# Simulated tiny dataset (e.g., note sequences as integers)
sequences = [
    [60, 62, 64, 65, 67],
    [67, 65, 64, 62, 60],
    [60, 61, 63, 65, 66],
    [66, 65, 63, 61, 60]
]
```
✅ **Explanation:** We create small sequences of MIDI note numbers. In real use, you’d extract thousands of note sequences from MIDI files.

---

### 🛠 **Step 3: Build Input–Target Pairs**

```python
X = []
y = []
for seq in sequences:
    for i in range(1, len(seq)):
        X.append(seq[:i])  # partial sequence
        y.append(seq[i])   # next note
```
✅ **Explanation:** We build input sequences (e.g., [60]) and targets (e.g., 62), progressively expanding the history.

---

### 🛠 **Step 4: Pad Sequences**

```python
maxlen = max(len(x) for x in X)
X_padded = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(X, maxlen=maxlen)
```
✅ **Explanation:** We pad sequences so they’re all the same length, required for batching.

---

### 🛠 **Step 5: Prepare Target Labels**

```python
vocab_size = 128  # MIDI notes range 0–127
y_categorical = to_categorical(y, num_classes=vocab_size)
```
✅ **Explanation:** We one-hot encode target notes for categorical cross-entropy loss.

---

### 🛠 **Step 6: Build the Model**

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=100, input_length=maxlen))
model.add(LSTM(128))
model.add(Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax'))
```
✅ **Explanation:**
- **Embedding layer** → Turns note indices into dense vectors.
- **LSTM layer** → Captures temporal patterns.
- **Dense layer** → Predicts the next note over all possible notes.

---

### 🛠 **Step 7: Compile the Model**

```python
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```
✅ **Explanation:** We use categorical cross-entropy because we’re classifying the next note; Adam optimizer for adaptive learning.

---

### 🛠 **Step 8: Train the Model**

```python
model.fit(X_padded, y_categorical, epochs=200, batch_size=2)
```
✅ **Explanation:** We train for 200 epochs (on real data, you’d use early stopping or validation) with a small batch size.

---

### 🏋 **Loss Calculation (Behind the Scenes)**

At each step:
- Model outputs a probability distribution over the 128 MIDI notes.
- We compare this to the one-hot true label.
- **Cross-entropy loss** at time step \( t \):

$$
\[
\text{Loss}_t = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(p_i)
\]
$$

where \( y_i \) is the true one-hot label, \( p_i \) is the predicted probability.

✅ If the model assigns high probability to the correct note, loss is low.

✅ If it predicts wrong notes, the loss increases, guiding weight updates.

---

### 🛠 **Step 9: Generate New Music (After Training)**

- Seed the model with a short starting sequence.
- Predict the next note.
- Append it to the sequence.
- Feed the updated sequence back into the model.
- Repeat until desired length.

✅ Sampling strategies like greedy search, top-k sampling, or temperature scaling help balance between predictability and creativity.
