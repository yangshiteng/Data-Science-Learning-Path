## ✂️🔁 **Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (Truncated BPTT)**

### 🧠 **What Is It?**

**Truncated BPTT** is a modified version of **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)** used to train **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** more efficiently on **long sequences**.

Instead of backpropagating through **all time steps** (which is slow and memory-intensive), Truncated BPTT:

* **Breaks the sequence into smaller chunks** (e.g., 20 time steps)
* **Unrolls** the RNN only for that chunk
* **Backpropagates** gradients within just that window

---

## 🔍 **Why Use Truncated BPTT?**

Full BPTT is expensive when:

* The sequence is long (e.g., 1,000+ time steps)
* Your model needs to train efficiently in real time

### ❌ Full BPTT Problems:

* High memory usage
* Long training times
* Risk of gradient vanishing or exploding

### ✅ Truncated BPTT Benefits:

* Faster training
* Lower memory consumption
* Makes it feasible to train on very long sequences

## 🔧 **How Truncated BPTT Works**

Imagine a long input sequence $x_1, x_2, ..., x_{1000}$

Instead of unrolling all 1000 steps, you:

1. **Split** the sequence into windows of fixed length (say, 20)
2. **Unroll** the RNN for just 20 steps
3. **Compute loss and backpropagate** only through those 20 steps
4. **Carry forward the hidden state** to the next chunk

```
[ x₁ ... x₂₀ ] → BPTT  → update
[ x₂₁ ... x₄₀ ] → BPTT → update
...
```

🧠 **Hidden state $h_t$ is passed between chunks** so the model retains memory across windows — but gradients are only computed within each window.

## 📐 **Truncated BPTT: Pseudocode**

```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    h_t = torch.zeros(batch_size, hidden_size)  # initial hidden state
    for i in range(0, sequence_length, truncation_len):
        inputs = sequence[i:i+truncation_len]
        targets = labels[i:i+truncation_len]

        # Forward pass through truncated window
        outputs, h_t = rnn(inputs, h_t.detach())  # detach to truncate gradient flow

        # Compute loss and backpropagate
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

> 🔧 `h_t.detach()` is key: it stops gradients from flowing back past the current chunk.
