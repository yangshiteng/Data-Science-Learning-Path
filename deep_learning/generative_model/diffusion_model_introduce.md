## üß† What Are Diffusion Models?

**Diffusion models** are a class of generative models that learn to generate data (like images or audio) by reversing a gradual noising process.

* They are **probabilistic models** inspired by thermodynamics and statistical physics.
* The idea is to **start with random noise** and learn how to **denoise** it into a structured output, like an image.

They‚Äôve become **state-of-the-art** in image synthesis, powering models like **DALL¬∑E 2**, **Stable Diffusion**, and **Imagen**.

## üîÑ How Do They Work?

Diffusion models work in two main steps:

### 1. **Forward Process (Noise Addition)**

* Start with real data (like an image).
* Add a small amount of Gaussian noise in many steps (e.g., 1,000 steps).
* Eventually, the data becomes **pure noise**.

Mathematically:

* At each step, you compute:

  $$
  x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} \cdot x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \cdot \epsilon_t
  $$

  where $\epsilon_t$ is Gaussian noise, and $\alpha_t$ controls how much noise is added.

### 2. **Reverse Process (Denoising)**

* A neural network (usually a **U-Net**) learns to **reverse** this process.
* Given a noisy sample $x_t$, the model predicts the noise component $\epsilon_t$.
* Then you reconstruct the cleaner version $x_{t-1}$.

At inference:

* Start with random noise, denoise it step by step until you get a realistic sample.

## üß™ Training Objective

The most common training objective is to **predict the noise** that was added to the image during the forward process.

This objective is usually implemented via **mean squared error (MSE)**:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{simple}} = \mathbb{E}_{x, t, \epsilon} \left[ \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \right\|^2 \right]
$$

Where:

* $x$ is a training sample
* $x_t$ is the noisy version at timestep $t$
* $\epsilon_\theta$ is the model‚Äôs predicted noise

## üß∞ Architecture Used

* Typically uses **U-Net** architecture with **time embeddings**.
* Time embeddings help the model know what step of the diffusion it is at.
* Often includes **attention mechanisms**, especially in high-resolution image models.
