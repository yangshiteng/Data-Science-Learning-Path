## üéØ What are GANs?

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** are a class of machine learning models designed to **generate new data** that resembles a given dataset (like images, audio, or text).
They were introduced by **Ian Goodfellow** and his colleagues in **2014**.

### üß† Key Idea

A GAN consists of **two neural networks**:

* **Generator (G)**: Tries to generate fake but realistic data.
* **Discriminator (D)**: Tries to detect whether a sample is real (from training data) or fake (from generator).

These two networks compete against each other in a **minimax game**, improving in the process.

## üß± GAN Architecture Overview

```
Random Noise (z) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Generator ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Fake Image ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Discriminator ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Fake or Real?
                      ‚ñ≤                                ‚ñ≤
            Tries to fool D                 Tries to detect fakes
```

### Components:

1. **Generator (G)**

   * Input: Random noise vector (`z`)
   * Output: Synthetic data (e.g. image)
   * Goal: Generate outputs that **fool the discriminator**

2. **Discriminator (D)**

   * Input: Real or fake data
   * Output: Probability the data is real
   * Goal: **Correctly classify** real vs. generated data

## ‚öñÔ∏è The Adversarial Training

### Generator Loss:

* Tries to **maximize** the chance that the discriminator **misclassifies fakes as real**

### Discriminator Loss:

* Tries to **minimize** classification error (correctly classify real and fake)

### Objective Function:

$\min_G \max_D \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{data}}}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]$

## üß™ Training GANs

GAN training is **notoriously unstable**. Common challenges:

* **Mode collapse**: Generator produces limited variety
* **Vanishing gradients**: Discriminator too good, generator stops learning
* **Balancing G and D**: If one is stronger, the other struggles

### Tips for Stability:

* Use **batch normalization**
* Apply **label smoothing**
* Try **Wasserstein GAN** (WGAN) for better convergence
