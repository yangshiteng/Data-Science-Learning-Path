# ðŸ”¹ The Three Main Types of Machine Learning

## 1. **Supervised Learning**

* **Idea:** Learn from **labeled data** (input â†’ correct output).
* **Goal:** Predict outcomes for new, unseen inputs.
* **Examples:**

  * Predicting house prices from features (size, location, etc.).
  * Image classification (cat vs. dog).

## 2. **Unsupervised Learning**

* **Idea:** Learn from **unlabeled data** (no right answers given).
* **Goal:** Find hidden patterns or groupings.
* **Examples:**

  * Customer segmentation (group shoppers by behavior).
  * Clustering news articles by topic.

---

## 3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

* **Idea:** Learn by **interacting with an environment**.
* **Goal:** Maximize **cumulative reward** over time.
* **Examples:**

  * A robot learning to walk.
  * An AI learning to play chess or Atari games.

| Aspect             | Supervised Learning             | Unsupervised Learning          | Reinforcement Learning             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Data**           | Labeled (input + output)        | Unlabeled (only input)         | No dataset; learns by interaction  |
| **Feedback**       | Direct (knows the right answer) | None (must discover structure) | Reward signals (positive/negative) |
| **Goal**           | Predict correct outputs         | Find hidden patterns           | Maximize long-term reward          |
| **Learning Style** | From examples                   | From data structure            | From trial and error               |
| **Example**        | Spam email detection            | Market segmentation            | Self-driving car                   |

âœ¨ **Simple analogy:**

* **Supervised:** Like a teacher giving you the correct answers.
* **Unsupervised:** Like exploring without guidance, grouping things yourself.
* **Reinforcement:** Like learning a game by playing it and getting points when you do well.
