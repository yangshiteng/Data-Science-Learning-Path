## üß† What Is Reinforcement Learning?

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by **interacting with an environment**. The agent tries actions, gets feedback in the form of rewards, and improves its strategy over time to **maximize the total reward**.

Think of it like teaching a dog tricks:

* You give the dog a treat when it does the right thing (reward).
* Over time, it learns which behaviors lead to treats (good outcomes).

## üß© Core Components of RL

### 1. **Agent**

The learner or decision maker (e.g., robot, software bot, game character).

### 2. **Environment**

The world the agent interacts with (e.g., a maze, a game, a simulation).

### 3. **State**

A snapshot of the environment (e.g., player position on a board).

### 4. **Action**

A choice the agent can make (e.g., move left, jump, pick object).

### 5. **Reward**

Feedback from the environment (e.g., +1 for reaching the goal, -1 for hitting a wall).

### 6. **Policy**

The strategy that the agent follows to decide what action to take in each state.

### 7. **Value Function**

Estimates how good a state or action is, in terms of expected future rewards.

## üîÅ How RL Works: The Loop

1. The **agent observes** the current state.
2. It **chooses an action** based on its policy.
3. The environment **responds with a new state and a reward**.
4. The agent **updates its strategy** based on the reward.
5. This loop continues until the task is done.

> üìà Over time, the agent improves its decisions by learning which actions lead to better rewards.

## üîÑ Exploration vs Exploitation

A fundamental trade-off in RL:

* **Exploration**: Try new actions to discover their effects.
* **Exploitation**: Use the known best actions to get high rewards.

The agent must balance both to learn effectively.

## üìö Types of Reinforcement Learning

### 1. **Model-Free RL**

* Learns directly from interactions without understanding the environment dynamics.
* Examples: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

### 2. **Model-Based RL**

* Builds a model of the environment and uses it to plan actions.
* More sample efficient, but more complex.

### 3. **Value-Based Methods**

* Focus on estimating value functions (like Q-Learning)

### 4. **Policy-Based Methods**

* Learn the policy directly without estimating value functions (e.g., Policy Gradients)

### 5. **Actor-Critic Methods**

* Combine value-based and policy-based methods.
