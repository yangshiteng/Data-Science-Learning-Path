# 🛠️ RL Recommendation System: Step-by-Step Project Plan

---

## **Step 1. Problem Setup**

🎯 Define the problem like a recommendation platform:

* **Users** → simplified profiles (age, genre preference, or random vectors).
* **Items** → articles, movies, or products (each with features).
* **Goal** → recommend items → user clicks/watches = reward.

👉 Start small: maybe **3–5 items** and simulate “click probability” per user.

---

## **Step 2. Environment (Simulation)**

Just like CartPole is an RL environment, we’ll create a **RecommenderEnv**:

* **State**: user profile (e.g., \[likes\_sports, likes\_news, likes\_movies])
* **Action**: index of the recommended item
* **Reward**: 1 if user clicks (probabilistic), 0 otherwise
* **Episode**: one recommendation session = a few steps

👉 Example: If a sports fan gets recommended football highlights, reward is more likely.

---

## **Step 3. Baseline: Multi-Armed Bandit 🎰**

Before diving into deep RL, start with **ε-greedy bandit**:

```python
# 3 items with true click probabilities
true_probs = [0.2, 0.5, 0.7]  

# estimates
Q = [0, 0, 0]  
N = [0, 0, 0]  
epsilon = 0.1  

for t in range(1000):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        action = np.random.randint(3)  # explore
    else:
        action = np.argmax(Q)          # exploit

    reward = np.random.rand() < true_probs[action]
    N[action] += 1
    Q[action] += (reward - Q[action]) / N[action]

print("Learned values:", Q)
```

👉 This mimics a recommender exploring items and learning which users like most.

## **Step 4. Upgrade: RL Agent (Q-learning or DQN)**

* Use **Stable Baselines3** to train an agent in your custom environment.
* Try `PPO` or `DQN`.
* The agent will learn a **policy**: given a user profile (state), what to recommend (action).

```python
from stable_baselines3 import DQN
model = DQN("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
```

---

## **Step 5. Evaluation**

* Compare **Bandit** vs. **RL agent** performance.
* Metrics: average click-through rate (CTR), long-term reward per episode.
* Plot learning curves 📈 to see improvement.

---

## **Step 6. Add Complexity (Optional, Advanced)**

* More users, more items.
* Contextual bandits (user context affects reward).
* Sequential session recommendations (not just one step).
* Simulated “user boredom” (too many repeats = less reward).

---

## **Step 7. Wrap Up**

* Save the trained model (`model.save("recommender_agent")`).
* Show a demo: input a user profile → agent outputs item recommendation.
