Training the agent is just half the story; in the real world, you often need to **deploy** it so it can actually make decisions in a live system (a game, a robot, a web service, etc.).

Let’s break it down simply:

---

# 🚀 How to Use (Deploy) a Trained RL Agent

## 1. Save the Model

Most RL libraries (like **Stable Baselines3**) let you save after training:

```python
model.save("cartpole_agent")
```

Later, load it:

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
model = PPO.load("cartpole_agent")
```

---

## 2. Use the Agent to Act (Inference)

After deployment, you don’t train anymore — the agent just **takes observations → gives actions**:

```python
obs, _ = env.reset()
done = False
while not done:
    action, _ = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)  # agent decides
    obs, reward, done, trunc, info = env.step(action)   # apply in environment
```

👉 That’s the deployed agent “playing the game” (or controlling your system).

## 3. Deployment Options

### 🖥️ A. Inside a Simulation (like CartPole, games, robotics simulators)

* Use the saved model directly inside the simulation.
* Great for experiments, games, and robotics research.

### 🌐 B. As a Web/Backend Service

* Wrap the agent in an **API** (e.g., FastAPI or Flask in Python).
* Other applications send **state (input)** → your agent returns **action (decision)**.
* Example:

  * Game server asks: “What move should the AI make?”
  * Agent replies: “Move left.”

### 🤖 C. On a Robot or Device

* Export the trained policy (often a neural network).
* Run it on the robot’s computer, microcontroller, or edge device.
* Example: a robotic arm uses the RL policy to decide its motor commands.

### ☁️ D. In the Cloud

* If you need **scale** (e.g., recommendations, trading bots), deploy the RL agent as a cloud service.
* Use containerization (Docker) + orchestration (Kubernetes).

---

## 4. Monitoring After Deployment

* Track performance (is the agent still good in the real environment?).
* Sometimes, the real world is different from training (distribution shift).
* You may need **periodic retraining** or fine-tuning.

# 🎯 Simple Example (CartPole Deployment)

Imagine you want the trained agent to run automatically:

1. Train in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Save model → `ppo_cartpole.zip`.
3. Wrap it in a function or API:

   ```python
   def get_action(state):
       action, _ = model.predict(state, deterministic=True)
       return action
   ```
4. Now you can call `get_action()` from anywhere (a game loop, a web app, etc.).

✨ So in short:
**Train → Save → Load → Use for decisions (deploy in your target system).**
