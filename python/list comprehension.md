    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
    newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits]
    print(newlist)
    > ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'mango']
    In this example, the item that is not banana keep the same, the item that is banana is replaced by orange
