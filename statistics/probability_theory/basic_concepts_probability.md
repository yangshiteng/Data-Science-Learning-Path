# What is Probability?
Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.

# Key Concepts in Probability Theory:

## 1. Random Experiment
A random experiment is an action or process that leads to one of several possible outcomes. The result cannot be predicted with certainty.

## 2. Sample Space
The sample space (denoted as S) is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For instance, the sample space for a coin toss is {Heads, Tails}.

## 3. Event
An event is a set of outcomes (a subset of the sample space) to which a probability is assigned. For example, getting a 'Heads' in a coin toss is an event.

## 4. Probability of an Event
The probability of an event A occurring is denoted as P(A). It quantifies the likelihood of the event happening and is calculated based on the outcomes in the sample space.

## 5. Types of Events
- **Simple Event**: An event with only one outcome.
- **Compound Event**: An event with more than one outcome.
- **Independent Events**: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.
- **Dependent Events**: Two events are dependent if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other.
- **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.

## 6. Probability Rules
- **Addition Rule**: For two mutually exclusive events, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).
- **Multiplication Rule**: For two independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

## 7. Complementary Events
The complement of an event A is the event that A does not occur, denoted as A'. The probability of the complementary event is P(A') = 1 - P(A).

# Examples with Explanation

## Basic Probability Calculation
Suppose you toss a fair coin once. The sample space is {Heads, Tails}.

- Probability of getting 'Heads': P(Heads) = 1/2 because there are 2 outcomes and each is equally likely.

## Calculating Probability for a Dice Roll
When rolling a fair six-sided die, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

- Probability of rolling a number greater than 4: P(number > 4) = 2/6 = 1/3, since only the outcomes 5 and 6 satisfy the condition.

## Using the Complementary Rule
If the probability of raining tomorrow is 0.2, then the probability of not raining is:

- P(not raining) = 1 - P(raining) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

# Conclusion

Probability theory forms the backbone of statistical analysis, enabling the study of randomness and uncertainty in various phenomena. Understanding these basic concepts is crucial for further exploration and application in fields ranging from finance to science and engineering.
