# What is a Bar Chart?
A bar chart is a visual representation used in statistics to show data across different categories using bars of different heights or lengths. Each bar represents a category of data, and the height or length of the bar corresponds to the value or frequency of that category.

# Key Characteristics of Bar Charts:
- **Bars**: Vertical or horizontal rectangles where each bar represents a different category.
- **Length or Height of Bars**: Represents the value or frequency of the category. In vertical bar charts, the height is used; in horizontal bar charts, the length.
- **Axis**: Typically, one axis of the bar chart shows the categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value.

# Uses of Bar Charts:
- To compare numeric values across different categories.
- Ideal for showing changes over time when the categories are time intervals.
- Useful for illustrating the distribution of categorical data.

# Examples with Python Code

## Basic Vertical Bar Chart Example
This example creates a simple vertical bar chart using Python's Matplotlib library to show the sales of different fruits.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data to plot
fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date']
sales = [150, 250, 175, 200]

# Plotting the bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(fruits, sales, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Sales of Different Fruits')
plt.xlabel('Fruit')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()
```
