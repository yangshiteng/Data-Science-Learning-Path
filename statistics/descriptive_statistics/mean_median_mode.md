# Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode

In descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency are statistical measures that describe the average or most typical value in a data set. The three most common measures are the mean, median, and mode, each of which provides a unique insight into the data's distribution.

## 1. Mean (Average)
- **Definition**: The mean is the sum of all values in a data set divided by the number of values. It is commonly known as the average.
- **Calculation**: 
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all data points}}{\text{Number of data points}}
  \]
- **Characteristics**:
  - Sensitive to outliers and skewed data.
  - Best used for data that is symmetrically distributed without outliers.
- **Example**: If a dataset includes the values [2, 3, 5, 7, 11], the mean is \( (2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11) / 5 = 5.6 \).

## 2. Median
- **Definition**: The median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
- **Calculation**:
  - Sort the data.
  - Identify the middle value or calculate the average of the two middle values.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Not affected by outliers or a skewed distribution.
  - Represents the 50th percentile of a data set.
- **Example**: For the data set [2, 3, 5, 7, 11], the median is 5. For [2, 3, 5, 7], the median is \( (3+5)/2 = 4 \).

## 3. Mode
- **Definition**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. There can be more than one mode if two or more values appear with the same highest frequency.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Useful for categorical data.
  - Can have multiple modes or no mode at all if no number repeats.
- **Example**: In the data set [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4], the mode is 4 because it appears the most frequently.

## Conclusion

The mean, median, and mode are essential tools in statistical analysis, each offering a different type of insight into the central tendency of a data set. The choice of which measure to use depends on the dataâ€™s distribution and the presence of outliers.
