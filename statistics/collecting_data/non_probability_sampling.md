# Non-Probability Sampling Techniques

Non-probability sampling methods are useful in exploratory research where the goal is to get an initial understanding of the hypothesis rather than to make inferential statistical predictions about the population. Here's a breakdown of the most commonly used non-probability sampling methods:

## 1. Convenience Sampling (简单抽样)
- **Definition**: Convenience sampling involves choosing individuals who are easiest to reach or readily available. The sample consists of participants who meet certain practical criteria, such as easy accessibility, geographical proximity, or willingness to participate.
- **Advantages**:
  - Economical and easy.
  - Saves time and effort in gathering data.
- **Limitations**:
  - High risk of bias.
  - Results cannot be generalized to the broader population.
- **Example**: An interviewer conducting market research interviews only visitors to a single shopping mall because of limited time and resources.

## 2. Judgmental or Purposive Sampling (判断性或有目的的抽样)
- **Definition**: Judgmental or purposive sampling involves selecting participants according to the judgment of the researcher, based on the needs of the study. The researcher uses their expertise to choose participants who are most representative of the population of interest.
- **Advantages**:
  - Allows for focus on particularly important or informative subjects.
  - Useful when detailed understanding from specific sub-groups is needed.
- **Limitations**:
  - Highly subjective method.
  - Potential for researcher bias influencing selection.
- **Example**: A researcher studying the opinions of startup founders on investment climates deliberately selects a sample of founders known for their influential impacts on the industry.

## 3. Quota Sampling (配额抽样)
- **Definition**: Quota sampling involves segmenting the population into mutually exclusive sub-groups, similar to stratification, then choosing subjects non-randomly from each segment to meet a proportional quota.
- **Advantages**:
  - Ensures that the sample reflects certain characteristics of the population.
  - More controlled than convenience sampling as it aims to represent significant traits of the population.
- **Limitations**:
  - The selection of participants within each quota is still non-random.
  - Can introduce bias if quotas do not accurately reflect the population structure.
- **Example**: A researcher divides a population into sub-groups of different income levels and then non-randomly selects a predetermined number of participants from each group to ensure that the income range is represented.

## Conclusion

While non-probability sampling methods are less able to support statistical inferences about the population due to potential selection bias, they provide practical, economical, and efficient means of acquiring data in certain situations. Their use is particularly prevalent in preliminary research stages and where probability sampling is impractical.
