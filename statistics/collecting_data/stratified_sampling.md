# Stratified Sampling

Stratified sampling is a method used to ensure that subgroups within a population are adequately represented within the sample. This approach can improve the accuracy and reliability of the results, particularly when different strata within the population vary significantly.

## Definition and Process
- **Definition**: Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups known as strata and then randomly sampling from each stratum proportionally or equally.
- **Process**:
  1. Identify the stratifying variables that are relevant to the research.
  2. Divide the population into strata based on these variables.
  3. Perform random sampling within each stratum.

## Characteristics
- **Homogeneity within Strata**: Each stratum is internally homogeneous (similar characteristics within the group).
- **Heterogeneity between Strata**: Strata are different from each other, ensuring variability across the population is captured.
- **Proportional or Equal Sampling**: Samples can be drawn proportionally (size of sample proportional to size of stratum) or equally (same size from each stratum) depending on the research goal.

## Advantages
- **Increased Precision**: By focusing on distinct categories, stratified sampling often results in more precise estimates than those derived from a simple random sample of the same size.
- **Improved Representation**: Ensures that all segments of the population are represented in the sample, including minority groups that might be overlooked in a simple random sampling approach.

## Limitations
- **Complexity in Planning**: Requires comprehensive knowledge of the population and careful planning to identify appropriate strata.
- **Higher Cost and Time**: Can be more costly and time-consuming than simple random sampling due to the need for additional organization and stratification before sampling.

## Examples
1. **Customer Satisfaction Survey**: A company has a diverse customer base categorized by age group. To understand customer satisfaction, it stratifies its customer population into age groups (<20, 20-40, 40-60, >60) and randomly selects a proportional number of customers from each group to ensure all age groups are adequately represented.
2. **Educational Research**: A study aims to assess educational achievements across different socioeconomic groups within a school district. The district uses stratified sampling to divide the student population into strata based on socioeconomic status, then samples an equal number of students from each stratum.
3. **Healthcare Study**: To investigate health outcomes by gender in a large city, researchers divide the population into male and female strata and select a proportional random sample from each group to ensure that both genders' health outcomes are equally represented.

## Conclusion

Stratified sampling is particularly useful in research that requires analysis across different subgroups defined by certain characteristics. This method enhances the representativeness of the sample and increases the generalizability of the findings to the entire population.
